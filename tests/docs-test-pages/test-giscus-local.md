# Test Giscus Integration

This page tests the Giscus comments integration.

## Expected Behavior

When properly configured:

- Comments section appears below this content
- Uses the Mandalorian dark theme styling
- Shows "Sign in with GitHub" if not authenticated

## Current Status

If you see an error about "giscus is not installed", it means:

1. The Giscus app needs to be installed on the repository
2. GitHub Discussions need to be enabled
3. The repository IDs need to be updated

## Styling Preview

Even without a working backend, you should see:

- The "Comments" heading
- The Giscus container with proper styling
- Dark theme matching the DRUIDS aesthetic
