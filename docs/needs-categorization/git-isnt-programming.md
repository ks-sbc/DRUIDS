# Git Isn't Programming

## The Big Lie

Someone told you Git is a "programming tool." They lied. Or more accurately, they confused you with incomplete truth.

Git is a **writing tool** that programmers happen to use. Like how Microsoft Word is a writing tool that novelists happen to use. You don't need to be a novelist to use Word. You don't need to be a programmer to use Git.

## What Git Actually Is

### Git is Track Changes on Steroids

Remember "Track Changes" in Microsoft Word? Where you can:
- See who changed what
- When they changed it
- Accept or reject changes
- Compare versions

Git does all that, but:
- It never forgets (Word only keeps recent changes)
- Multiple people can propose changes simultaneously
- You can't accidentally lose work
- No corporation controls it

### Git is Democratic Google Docs

Imagine if Google Docs:
- Worked without internet
- Couldn't be shut down by Google
- Let anyone propose changes without breaking the original
- Kept perfect history forever
- Showed exactly who decided what and when
- Never lost a document
- Couldn't be subpoenaed as easily

That's Git.

### Git is Organizational Memory

Think of Git as:
- A filing cabinet that organizes itself
- A meeting secretary that never misses details
- A historian that remembers everything
- A librarian that finds anything instantly

## Why Programmers Confused You

Programmers use Git for code. So when they explain Git, they use programming examples:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

This scares organizers away. But Git doesn't care what you store. Watch the same Git process with organizing content:

```markdown
# March 15 General Meeting Minutes

Present: Rosa, Karl, Emma, Malcolm
Facilitator: Rosa

## Decisions Made
1. Rent strike campaign approved (7-2-1)
2. $500 allocated for printing
3. Next meeting: March 22
```

See? No programming. Just organizing.

## The Only "Technical" Parts

### 1. The Command Line Isn't Programming

When you type:
```bash
git add meeting-minutes.md
```

You're not programming. You're giving instructions. Like typing:
- "print document.pdf"
- "save as draft.doc"
- "email to everyone"

### 2. These Aren't Code Words

Git commands are just English:
- `add` = include this
- `commit` = save forever
- `push` = share with others
- `pull` = get updates
- `status` = what's happening?
- `log` = show history

### 3. You Already Understand Branches

A "branch" sounds technical. It's not:

**Real life**: "Let's try planning the march for Saturday"
**Git**: Create branch called `march-saturday-proposal`

**Real life**: "Actually, Sunday works better"
**Git**: Create another branch `march-sunday-proposal`

**Real life**: "We voted for Sunday"
**Git**: Merge `march-sunday-proposal` into main plan

## What You Need vs What You Don't

### You DON'T Need to Know:
- Any programming language
- How Git works internally
- Complex Git features
- Computer science concepts
- Technical jargon

### You DO Need to Know:
- How to type
- How to create folders
- How to save files
- How to follow simple instructions
- How to ask for help

## Common Fears Debunked

### "I'll Break Everything"

**Fear**: "What if I delete all our work?"
**Reality**: Git is designed to prevent this. It's harder to lose work in Git than in Google Docs.

### "It's Too Complicated"

**Fear**: "There are hundreds of Git commands!"
**Reality**: You need 7 commands for 90% of organizing work. You already remember more phone numbers than that.

### "I'm Not Technical"

**Fear**: "I don't understand computers"
**Reality**: Do you use:
- Email? That's a distributed message protocol.
- Google Docs? That's real-time collaborative editing.
- Facebook? That's a complex social graph database.

You're already technical. You just don't use programmer words for it.

### "I Don't Have Time"

**Fear**: "Learning Git will take forever"
**Reality**: 
- 30 minutes to make your first commit
- 1 week to feel comfortable
- 2 weeks to wonder how you lived without it

Compare to: How long does it take to find that document from 6 months ago?

## The Political Truth

Here's why programmers gatekeep Git: **Knowledge is power**.

When technical knowledge stays with "technical people," it creates hierarchy. When organizers depend on tech volunteers, it creates bottlenecks. When tools seem "too hard," it maintains divisions.

Learning Git isn't about becoming technical. It's about refusing the artificial division between "technical" and "non-technical" comrades.

## Real Organizers Using Git

### Rosa's Story
"I coordinate a tenants union. I thought Git was for coders. Now I track every meeting, every decision, every campaign in Git. When the city tried to claim we never opposed their development plan, I pulled up the commit from 2 years ago with our detailed objections. Git is revolutionary infrastructure."

### Malcolm's Experience
"I'm 67 years old. Started organizing before computers existed. Learned Git last month. Now I teach it to younger comrades because I understand: Git is just a better filing cabinet. The revolution needs better filing cabinets."

### Emma's Revelation
"I avoided Git for years because tech bros made it sound impossible. Then a comrade showed me: it's just saving and sharing documents with memory. I learned it in a weekend. Now I run Git trainings for our whole organization."

## Your Path Forward

1. **Today**: Read this document, realize Git isn't programming
2. **Tomorrow**: Read "Why Revolutionaries Need Git"
3. **This Week**: Do the "Your First Revolutionary Commit" tutorial
4. **Next Week**: Use Git for real meeting minutes
5. **In a Month**: Teach another comrade

## The Bottom Line

Git isn't programming. It's infrastructure for organizing. Like phones, email, or meeting spaces - tools we use without being "technical."

The question isn't whether you're "technical enough" for Git. The question is whether you're ready to stop letting corporations control your organizational memory.

You don't need to be a programmer. You need to be an organizer who refuses to lose another decision to digital amnesia.
