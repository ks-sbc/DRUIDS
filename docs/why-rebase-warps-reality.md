# Why Git Rebase Warps Reality (And Why That's Dangerous for Organizing)

## The Brilliant Observation

A comrade's partner recently explained Git in a way that cuts through all the technical mystification:

> "Git doesn't track files. It tracks changes. Like recording driving directions, not destinations."

This is profound. And it perfectly explains why `git rebase` is so dangerous for collective work.

## The Highway Metaphor

### How Git Actually Works

Imagine your organizing project as a road trip. Each commit isn't a location - it's a set of driving directions:

```
Commit 1: "Start at headquarters, drive north 10 miles"
Commit 2: "Turn left, drive west 50 miles" 
Commit 3: "Turn right, drive north 30 miles"
```

Git doesn't record "You are now at Cedar City." It records "You drove north 10 miles, then west 50 miles, then north 30 miles."

### How We Think Git Works

Most people think Git saves snapshots:
- "Here's what the files looked like at 3 PM"
- "Here's what they looked like at 4 PM"

But that's wrong. Git saves deltas (changes):
- "At 3 PM, you added these lines"
- "At 4 PM, you deleted those lines"

## Enter Rebase: The Reality Warper

### What Rebase Claims to Do

Rebase says: "Let's clean up history by moving commits around."

In highway terms: "Let's pretend you took a different route to get here."

### The Impossible Physics

Here's where it breaks reality:

**Original journey**:
1. Start at HQ
2. Drive north 10 miles (organizing meeting)
3. Turn left, drive west 50 miles (outreach campaign)
4. Turn right, drive north 30 miles (protest planning)

**After rebase**:
1. Start at HQ
2. Drive north 10 miles
3. Turn left, drive west 50 miles
4. [Your commits rebased here]
5. You're somehow 30 miles EAST of where you started

### The Physics Problem

If you:
- Started at point A
- Took a left turn
- Drove west for 50 miles
- How the hell are you east of where you started?

**You can't be. It's physically impossible.**

But rebase creates this impossibility by rewriting the journey while trying to preserve the destination.

## Why This Matters for Revolutionary Organizing

### 1. Shared Reality Is Essential

Democratic centralism requires shared truth. When five comrades are working on a campaign:
- Rosa commits meeting notes
- Karl commits financial records  
- Emma commits outreach data
- Malcolm commits security protocols
- You rebase to "clean up"

Suddenly, everyone else's reality breaks. Their commits reference a history that no longer exists. They pull, and Git says "I don't know where you are anymore."

### 2. Trust Requires Truthful History

```bash
git log --before="last week"
# Should show what ACTUALLY happened last week
# Not some "cleaned up" fiction
```

When you rebase:
- Meeting notes from March 15 might now appear before the March 14 planning session
- Decisions made in response to events now appear to predict those events
- The collective memory becomes a lie

### 3. Accountability Vanishes

**Before rebase**:
```
March 10: "Propose direct action"
March 11: "Security concerns raised"
March 12: "Modify proposal for safety"
March 13: "Approved with modifications"
```

**After rebase**:
```
March 10: "Propose safe direct action"
March 13: "Approved"
```

Where did the security discussion go? Who raised concerns? How did we address them? Rebase ate your accountability.

## Real World Damage

### Scenario 1: The Lost Debate

Your organization debates a controversial tactic. After hours of discussion, you reach consensus with important constraints. Someone rebases to "clean up" the commit history. 

Six months later, when someone asks "Why did we decide X?", the reasoning is gone. The debate never happened. You just mysteriously have a decision.

### Scenario 2: The Broken Branch

Five comrades work on a campaign. One rebases the main branch to "organize better." Everyone else pulls and:

```bash
error: failed to push some refs
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. 
```

But they're not behind - reality warped. Now everyone stops organizing to fix Git.

### Scenario 3: The Security Nightmare

```bash
# Original history
Commit A: "Add meeting notes"
Commit B: "SECURITY: Remove real names from notes"

# After rebase
Commit A': "Add meeting notes" (now includes the removed names)
```

Rebase can resurrect deleted sensitive data by reapplying old changes in new contexts.

## The Alternative: Merge

Merge preserves reality:

```
      A---B---C topic
     /         \
D---E---F---G---H main
```

Everyone can see:
- The main line continued (D→E→F→G)
- A branch happened (A→B→C)
- They merged at H
- All history is real and traceable

## When People Push Rebase

### "But Clean History!"

**Them**: "Rebase makes history linear and clean!"
**You**: "Our history isn't linear. We're a collective."

Organizations aren't single-threaded. Multiple campaigns run simultaneously. Preserving that reality matters more than a pretty git log.

### "But Professional Developers!"

**Them**: "Real developers use rebase!"
**You**: "We're revolutionaries, not corporate code monkeys."

Professional developers often work alone on feature branches. Revolutionary organizations work collectively on shared reality.

### "But It's More Elegant!"

**Them**: "All those merge commits are ugly!"
**You**: "Democracy is messy. Hiding the mess doesn't eliminate it."

Those "ugly" merge commits show when ideas combined, when conflicts got resolved, when collective decisions happened.

## The Rules for Revolutionary Git

1. **Never rebase shared branches** - If others have seen it, don't rewrite it
2. **Never rebase after pushing** - Published history is sacrosanct
3. **Preserve collective memory** - Every commit is organizational history
4. **Embrace merge commits** - They show real collaboration
5. **Local cleanup only** - Rebase your private thoughts, never shared work

## The Technical Truth

For those who want to understand deeper:

### Git's Content-Addressable Storage

Each commit has a SHA hash based on:
- The changes in that commit
- The parent commit's hash
- The timestamp
- The author

Change ANY of these (which rebase does), and you create an entirely new commit. The old one doesn't "move" - it's abandoned, and a deceptive copy takes its place.

### The Directed Acyclic Graph

Git history is a DAG - commits point to parents, never children. Rebase breaks this by:
1. Creating new commits with different parents
2. Pretending they're the "same" commits
3. Forcing everyone to abandon the old reality

## What To Use Instead

### For Cleaning Local Work

```bash
# Before pushing, combine related commits
git commit --amend  # Fix the last commit
```

### For Integrating Changes

```bash
# Always preserve reality
git merge main  # Brings main's changes to your branch
```

### For Organizing History

Use clear commit messages instead of rewriting history:
```bash
git commit -m "Meeting notes: March 15 general assembly

- Decided on rent strike date (April 1)
- Allocated resources for tenant outreach  
- Created security protocols for action"
```

## The Revolutionary Perspective

In corporate development, hiding mess creates an illusion of perfection. In revolutionary organizing, acknowledging mess builds trust.

When a comrade sees:
```
Merge branch 'march-proposal-v3' after security review
```

They know:
- There were multiple proposals
- Security reviewed them
- The collective process worked

That's not messy history. That's democratic centralism in action.

## Conclusion: Choose Reality

Git rebase is a tool for those who value pretty lies over messy truth. Revolutionary organizations need tools that preserve collective reality, not rewrite it.

Every commit is a decision. Every merge is consensus. Every branch is an idea being developed. This is our organizational memory - don't let anyone convince you to lobotomize it for aesthetics.

When someone suggests rebase, ask them: "Why do you want to hide our democratic process?"

Because that's what rebase does. It takes the beautiful, messy, collective reality of organizing and replaces it with a fiction where everything was perfect from the start.

We're not perfect. We're revolutionary. And our Git history should reflect that truth.
