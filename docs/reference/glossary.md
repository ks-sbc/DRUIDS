# DRUIDS Glossary

## Core Terms

### DRUIDS
Democratic, Resilient, Unity-building Information Distribution System. Infrastructure for revolutionary organizations to preserve knowledge, coordinate work, and resist surveillance.

### Institutional Memory
The accumulated knowledge, decisions, and lessons of an organization that persists beyond individual members. What gets lost when experienced organizers leave.

**Learn more:** [Institutional Memory and Revolutionary Capacity](../learn/core-concepts/institutional-memory.md)

### Democratic Centralism
Organizational principle: freedom of discussion, unity of action. In Git: branches for debate, merges for unity, history preserving dissent.

### Three-Tier Security Model
- **L0 (Green)**: Public information, educational materials
- **L1 (Brown)**: Member-only content, operational data
- **L2 (Red)**: Sensitive strategic planning, high-security

**Implementation details:** [Security Implementation](../learn/core-concepts/druids-security-implementation.md) and [Security Red Lines](../learn/druids-fundamentals/druids-red-lines.md)

### Power Steering Metaphor
DRUIDS as infrastructure that makes organizing easier without providing direction. The ideology is your compass; DRUIDS is power steering.

## Git Terms for Organizers

**New to Git?** Start with [Git Isn't Programming](../learn/git-basics/git-isnt-programming.md) and [Git in 7 Commands](../learn/git-basics/git-in-7-commands.md)

### Repository (Repo)
Your organization's complete history and current files. Like a filing cabinet that never forgets.

### Commit
A saved snapshot of your work with a description. Like filing a document with a note about what it is and why.

### Branch
A parallel version for experimenting or proposing changes. Like drafting a proposal before presenting it.

### Merge
Combining different branches of work. Like voting to accept a proposal and implement it.

### Clone
Making a complete copy of the repository. Every member has the full history.

### Push/Pull
Sharing your changes (push) or getting others' changes (pull). Like distributing meeting minutes.

### Conflict
When two people change the same thing differently. Like competing amendments that need reconciliation.

## Revolutionary Terms

### Material Conditions
The actual, concrete circumstances of organizing - not abstract theory. DRUIDS addresses material problems like burnout and knowledge loss.

### Prefigurative Politics
Building the new world in the shell of the old. DRUIDS prefigures collective ownership and democratic process.

### Technical Labor Aristocracy
Those who hoard technical knowledge to maintain power. DRUIDS breaks this by democratizing skills.

**Fight this pattern:** [Teaching Without Priesthood](../teach/teach-tech-without-priest-hood.md)

### Security Culture
Collective practices that protect without paranoia. Based on real threats, not fantasy.

### Bus Factor
How many people could leave before the organization fails. Traditional: 1-2. With DRUIDS: much higher.

## DRUIDS-Specific Terms

### Revolutionary Commit Conventions
Commit messages that encode democratic process:
- `DECIDED[body](vote): description`
- `EDUCATED[topic]: description`
- `EMERGENCY[auth]: description`

### Knowledge Artifact
Documentation that preserves lessons, decisions, or processes. Campaign retrospectives, meeting minutes, etc.

### Federation
Multiple DRUIDS instances coordinating while maintaining autonomy. Like chapters sharing knowledge.

### Air-gapped
Completely disconnected from internet for maximum security. Used for L2 sensitive planning.

### Pseudonym Discipline
Consistent use of revolutionary names across platforms to prevent identity correlation.

## Technical Terms Simplified

### Encryption
Scrambling data so only authorized people can read it. Like a cipher that protects messages.

### Version Control
Tracking all changes over time. Like keeping every draft of a document with notes about what changed.

### Plain Text
Simple text files readable by any computer. No special software needed, works forever.

### Markdown
Simple formatting for plain text. Like `**bold**` or `# Heading`. Easy to learn, works everywhere.

### SSH/GPG Keys
Digital credentials that prove identity. Like unforgeable signatures for digital work.

### Tor
Network that hides your internet location. Like mailing letters without return addresses.

## Anti-Patterns

### Discord Democracy
Voting in chat where history disappears. No record of decisions or dissent.

### Google Socialism
Shared documents on surveillance platforms. Collective ownership, corporate control.

### Signal Security Theater
Encrypted messages with no infrastructure. Protects chat, not organizing capacity.

### Tech Priest
Person who hoards technical knowledge to maintain power. Often burns out, taking knowledge with them.

### Zoom Organizing
Presence without infrastructure. Meetings happen but nothing persists.

## Workflow Terms

### Onboarding
Getting new members productive quickly. Traditional: months. With DRUIDS: days.

### Retrospective
Documented analysis after campaigns/projects. What worked, what didn't, lessons learned.

### Knowledge Hemorrhaging
Constant loss of experience when people leave. The problem DRUIDS solves.

### Self-Service Documentation
Information organized so people can find answers without asking. Reduces burnout.

### Commit Signing
Cryptographic proof of who made changes. Prevents impersonation.

## Security Terms

### Threat Model
Realistic assessment of actual dangers. Not paranoid fantasy but material analysis.

### OpSec (Operational Security)
Practices that protect sensitive information. Being boring is good OpSec.

### Compartmentalization
Limiting information to those who need it. Not secrecy but practical security.

### Forward Secrecy
Past communications stay secure even if current keys are compromised.

### Surveillance Capitalism
Business model of tracking everything for profit. Why we avoid corporate platforms.

## Common Phrases

### "Ask Sarah for the password"
Symbol of organizational fragility. When Sarah leaves, access dies.

### "Lost to Discord"
Information that exists somewhere in chat history but is effectively gone.

### "Starting from scratch"
What happens without institutional memory. Every campaign reinvents the wheel.

### "Technical hierarchy"
When specialized knowledge creates power imbalances. DRUIDS fights this.

### "The revolution will be committed"
Play on Gil Scott-Heron. The revolution needs version control.
