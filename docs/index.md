## What Makes This Different?

Traditional documentation asks "What type of document is this?" (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation).

We ask **"What are you trying to accomplish?"**

This matches how people actually learn and adopt new tools - through their journey, not through document categories.

## Getting Help

- **Stuck?** Each section has its own guide
- **Questions?** Check the glossary for terms
- **Contributing?** See our style guide

Remember: **Every expert was once a beginner.** Start where you are, not where you think you should be.
