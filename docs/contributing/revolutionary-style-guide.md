# DRUIDS Revolutionary Documentation Style Guide

## Purpose

This guide ensures DRUIDS documentation serves revolutionary organizations with clarity, discipline, and political coherence. We write for serious organizers building power against capitalism and state repression.

## Core Principles

### Revolutionary Voice
- **Direct and disciplined**: No corporate fluff or liberal hedging
- **Marxist-Leninist framework**: Use proper political terminology
- **Material analysis**: Ground everything in concrete conditions
- **Collective focus**: We, our, comrades - not individual users

### What We Are
- Revolutionary infrastructure
- Tools for democratic centralism
- Security against state repression
- Collective knowledge systems

### What We Are NOT
- Productivity software
- Corporate collaboration tools
- Liberal reform projects
- Individual solutions

## Language Guidelines

### Required Terminology

**Political Terms**
- "Comrade" not "user" or "customer"
- "Organization/formation" not "team" or "company"
- "Democratic centralism" explicitly named
- "State repression" not "privacy concerns"
- "Revolutionary discipline" not "best practices"
- "Collective responsibility" not "empowerment"

**Technical Terms**
- "Vault" for Obsidian workspace
- "Repository" for Git backend
- "L0/L1/L2" for security tiers
- "Commit" for saved changes
- "Branch" for proposals/experiments

### Forbidden Language

**Corporate Speak**
- ❌ ROI, cost savings, efficiency gains
- ❌ Stakeholder, customer, client
- ❌ Innovation, disruption, optimization
- ❌ Productivity, performance metrics
- ❌ Value proposition, use case

**Liberal Framing**
- ❌ Empowerment (without class analysis)
- ❌ Self-care (as individual solution)
- ❌ Safe space (without material safety)
- ❌ Inclusive (without power analysis)
- ❌ Ethics (abstract, not material)

## Documentation Types (Diátaxis Framework)

We organize documentation into four types based on comrades' needs:

### 1. Tutorials (Learning by Doing)
**Purpose**: Help new comrades acquire skills through practical exercises
**Approach**: 
- Take comrades step-by-step through their first experiences
- Focus on learning, not task completion
- Build confidence through early victories
- Use "we" language - you're learning together

**Example**: "Your First Revolutionary Commit" - teaches Git through creating meeting minutes

### 2. How-To Guides (Achieving Goals)
**Purpose**: Help experienced comrades accomplish specific organizing tasks
**Approach**:
- Assume basic knowledge, focus on the goal
- Provide clear, adaptable instructions
- Address real-world complexity
- Skip unnecessary explanation

**Example**: "Migrating from Google Surveillance" - practical steps for data liberation

### 3. Reference (Technical Information)
**Purpose**: Provide precise technical details when needed
**Approach**:
- Structured for quick lookup
- Complete and accurate
- Minimal explanation
- Include security implications

**Example**: "Three-Tier Security Model Specifications"

### 4. Explanation (Understanding)
**Purpose**: Deepen theoretical and practical understanding
**Approach**:
- Connect technical to political
- Provide historical context
- Explore contradictions
- Build revolutionary consciousness

**Example**: "Democratic Centralism Through Git"

### Critical Principle: Never Mix Types
Each document serves ONE primary purpose. A tutorial teaches, a how-to guides, reference informs, explanation illuminates. Mixing confuses comrades and weakens documentation.

### The Documentation Compass

When uncertain about documentation type, ask two questions:

1. **Does it inform ACTION or COGNITION?**
   - ACTION: Practical steps, doing things
   - COGNITION: Understanding, knowing things

2. **Does it help ACQUIRE or APPLY?**
   - ACQUIRE: Learning something new
   - APPLY: Using existing knowledge

**The Algorithm**:
```
IF content informs ACTION:
    IF helps ACQUIRE skill → TUTORIAL
    IF helps APPLY skill → HOW-TO GUIDE
    
IF content informs COGNITION:
    IF helps ACQUIRE understanding → EXPLANATION
    IF helps APPLY understanding → REFERENCE
```

**Quick Reference Matrix**:
| Purpose | Acquire | Apply |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Action** | Tutorial | How-To Guide |
| **Cognition** | Explanation | Reference |

## Examples

### Good ✅

> "DRUIDS implements democratic centralism through Git workflows, ensuring freedom of discussion in branches and unity of action in main."

> "The three-tier security model protects against state repression by compartmentalizing information based on operational necessity."

> "Collective knowledge management prevents burnout by distributing organizational memory across all members."

### Bad ❌

> "DRUIDS empowers users to collaborate more efficiently and maximize their productivity."

> "Our innovative solution disrupts traditional knowledge management with cutting-edge features."

> "Practice good self-care by delegating tasks within the intuitive interface."

## Specific Guidance

### Writing About Security

Frame as protection from real threats:
- State surveillance programs
- Corporate data harvesting
- Infiltration attempts
- Device seizures

NOT as abstract privacy.

### Writing About Democracy

Emphasize democratic centralism:
- Freedom of discussion
- Unity of action
- Minority positions preserved
- Collective decision-making

NOT liberal democracy or consensus.

### Writing About Sustainability

Focus on structural solutions:
- Distributed responsibility
- Collective infrastructure
- Systematic knowledge sharing
- Preventing individual burnout

NOT individual wellness.

## Tone by Audience

### For New Organizations
- Acknowledge current struggles
- Provide clear path forward
- Reference similar organizations
- Emphasize collective benefit

### For Technical Implementers
- Assume political alignment
- Focus on practical details
- Include security implications
- Provide complete examples

### For Experienced Organizers
- Respect existing knowledge
- Focus on specific benefits
- Address likely concerns
- Provide migration paths

## Implementation Approach (Diátaxis Method)

### Start Small, Build Organically
- Don't create empty documentation structures
- Work on existing content first
- Make one improvement at a time
- Publish immediately - don't wait for perfection

### Iterative Development
1. Choose a specific document
2. Identify which type it should be (tutorial/how-to/reference/explanation)
3. Assess against that type's criteria
4. Make ONE improvement
5. Publish and repeat

### Managing Complexity
As documentation grows:
- Add hierarchy only when needed
- Keep navigation simple (≤7 items per section)
- Group by user journey, not technical architecture
- Remember: comrades' needs drive structure

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Mixed types**: Each document serves ONE purpose
- **Completeness paralysis**: Better to have good partial docs than no docs
- **Over-structuring**: Let organization emerge from use
- **Technical focus**: Always connect to organizing needs

## Review Checklist

- [ ] References movement history appropriately
- [ ] Avoids all corporate/liberal language
- [ ] Provides concrete examples from organizing
- [ ] Emphasizes collective over individual
- [ ] Addresses security realistically
