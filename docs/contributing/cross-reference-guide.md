# Cross-Reference Guide for Revolutionary Documentation

## Material Problem This Solves

Organizers waste precious time hunting through disconnected documents. Without clear connections between theory and practice, comrades:
- Struggle to find the "how" after understanding the "why"
- Miss crucial prerequisites before attempting complex tasks
- Can't see how different pieces fit into their organizing journey
- Duplicate work because they can't find related efforts

This guide ensures every document connects meaningfully to the collective knowledge base.

## Political Framing

Knowledge hoarding is a tool of oppression. By creating clear pathways between documents, we:
- **Democratize access** to technical knowledge
- **Build collective intelligence** rather than individual expertise
- **Connect theory to practice** - the essence of praxis
- **Reduce barriers** for new organizers joining the struggle

## Cross-Reference Patterns

### 1. Journey Progression Links

These links move comrades forward in their DRUIDS journey:

```markdown
<!-- After explaining a concept -->
**Ready to put this into practice?** See [[druids-installation-guide|Installation Guide]]

<!-- After a tutorial -->
**Understand the theory behind this?** Explore [[institutional-memory|Institutional Memory]]

<!-- After implementation -->
**Ready to teach others?** Check out [[teach-tech-without-priest-hood|Teaching Without Hierarchy]]
```

**[EXPAND HERE: Add more journey progression examples from your organizing context]**

### 2. Material Prerequisites

Help comrades build necessary capacity before attempting tasks:

```markdown
<!-- At document start -->
> **Prerequisites**: Before diving in, make sure you understand:
> - [[git-in-7-commands|Git in 7 Commands]] - Basic Git literacy
> - [[druids-security-implementation|DRUIDS Security Implementation]] - Our security philosophy

<!-- Inline prerequisites -->
This workflow assumes you've completed [[your-first-revolutionary-commit|Your First Revolutionary Commit]].
```

**[EXPAND HERE: Create prerequisite chains for your specific workflows]**

### 3. Theory-to-Practice Connections

Every theoretical concept should link to its practical application:

```markdown
<!-- In theory documents -->
## Applying This Principle
See how democratic centralism works in practice:
- [[git-workflow-guide|Git Workflow Guide]] - Branches as working groups
- [[proposal-process|Proposal Process]] - PRs as democratic proposals

<!-- In practical guides -->
## Revolutionary Theory Behind This
This practice embodies:
- [[democratic-centralism|Democratic Centralism]] - Unity in action
- [[tech-democratization-as-class-struggle|Tech Democratization]] - Breaking knowledge hierarchies
```

**[EXPAND HERE: Map your organization's principles to concrete practices]**

### 4. Problem-Solution Mappings

Connect pain points to their solutions:

```markdown
<!-- In problem descriptions -->
### Experiencing This Issue?
- **Lost knowledge when comrades leave?** → [[institutional-memory|Institutional Memory]]
- **Burnout from repeated onboarding?** → [[onboarding-without-burnout|Onboarding Without Burnout]]
- **Security concerns about surveillance?** → [[security-playbook|Security Playbook]]
```

**[EXPAND HERE: Add your organization's specific challenges and solutions]**

### 5. Alternative Paths

Recognize different organizing contexts need different approaches:

```markdown
## Choose Your Path
Depending on your organizing context:

**For Labor Organizing:**
- Focus on [[meeting-workflow-guide|Meeting Workflows]]
- Prioritize [[security-audits-for-organizers|Security Audits]]

**For Tenant Unions:**
- Start with [[from-google-docs|Migration from Google]]
- Emphasize <!-- [[pseudonym-discipline|Pseudonym Discipline]] - Content to be created -->

**For Community Groups:**
- Begin with [[quick-demo|Quick Demo]]
- Build towards [[proposal-process|Proposal Process]]
```

**[EXPAND HERE: Add paths specific to your movement's sectors]**

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Academic Language
```markdown
<!-- Wrong -->
See also: Related theoretical frameworks in appendix B

<!-- Right -->
Put this into practice with: [[git-through-campaign|Git Through Campaign]]
```

### ❌ Circular References
```markdown
<!-- Wrong -->
For security, see Security Guide. (Security Guide: For basics, see this document)

<!-- Right -->
Build security knowledge progressively:
1. Start: [Why Security Matters](link1)
2. Learn: [Security Principles](link2)
3. Implement: [Security Playbook](link3)
```

### ❌ Dead-End Documents
Every document should link somewhere - no organizer left behind!

## Implementation Checklist

When adding cross-references to any document:

- [ ] **Entry Point**: How do comrades arrive here? Link back to their likely source
- [ ] **Prerequisites**: What capacity must they have built? Link to foundations
- [ ] **Next Steps**: Where do they go after this? Link forward in journey
- [ ] **Alternatives**: What if this doesn't fit their context? Link to options
- [ ] **Problems Solved**: What organizing challenges does this address? Link to solutions
- [ ] **Theory Connection**: How does this embody our principles? Link to concepts

## Cross-Reference Phrases That Work

Replace corporate/academic language with revolutionary framing:

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead |
|----------|----------------|
| "See also" | "Apply this in practice with..." |
| "Related documents" | "Build on this knowledge with..." |
| "For more information" | "Deepen your understanding through..." |
| "Refer to" | "Put this to work in..." |
| "As described in" | "Learn the foundation in..." |

**[EXPAND HERE: Add phrases that resonate with your organizing culture]**

## Maintaining the Web

Cross-references are living connections that need tending:

1. **Regular Audits**: Check links monthly during documentation sprints
2. **Journey Testing**: Have new comrades follow reference paths
3. **Feedback Loops**: Track which links comrades actually use
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Update based on organizing needs

## Remember

Every cross-reference is a bridge between isolation and collective power. Make them:
- **Clear**: Comrades know exactly what they'll find
- **Purposeful**: Each link serves the journey
- **Accessible**: Language that includes, not excludes
- **Revolutionary**: Reinforcing our values with every connection
