# Teaching DRUIDS

**New to teaching tech?** Start with [how to teach without creating hierarchies](../teach/teach-tech-without-priest-hood.md).

**Ready for structured workshops?** Use our [Git workshop template](../teach/workshops/git-through-campaign-template.md).

## Core Philosophy

Teaching DRUIDS isn't about creating technical experts - it's about democratizing knowledge and eliminating hierarchies. Every person who learns DRUIDS should be able to teach someone else.

## üéØ Teaching Principles

### No Tech Priests
- Rotate who teaches
- Make mistakes publicly  
- Emphasize that everyone can learn
- Destroy the mystique

### Material Examples
- Use real organizing scenarios
- Connect every concept to their work
- Show immediate practical value
- Build from their experience

### Collective Learning
- Pair teaching with practice
- Create study groups not lectures
- Share keyboards during demos
- Learn by doing together

## üìö Teaching Resources

### Foundational
- **[Teaching Tech Without Priesthood](../teach/teach-tech-without-priest-hood.md)** - Core pedagogical approach
- **[Workshop Materials](../teach/workshops/git-through-campaign-template.md)** - Ready-to-use session plans
- **[Learning Paths](../learn/visual-roadmaps.md)** - Different journeys for different contexts
- **[Revolutionary Style Guide](../contributing/revolutionary-style-guide.md)** - Help learners navigate

### Workshop Templates

#### Introduction Workshop (2 hours)
1. Why we need revolutionary infrastructure (30 min)
2. Demo: Your first commit (30 min)
3. Hands-on: Document a real meeting (45 min)
4. Q&A and troubleshooting (15 min)

#### Git Basics Workshop (3 hours)
1. Git isn't programming (20 min)
2. The magnificent seven commands (40 min)
3. Practice: [Git Through Campaign](../teach/workshops/git-through-campaign.md) (90 min)
4. Conflict resolution exercise (30 min)

#### Security Workshop (2.5 hours)
1. Threat assessment for organizers (45 min)
2. Three-tier security model (30 min)
3. Practice: Encryption and keys (45 min)
4. Security culture discussion (30 min)

## üéì Learning Paths by Role

### For New Members
**Goal:** Contributing within one week

1. Orientation to DRUIDS concept
2. First commit exercise
3. Daily workflow practice
4. Finding information skills

### For Facilitators
**Goal:** Run effective meetings with DRUIDS

1. Meeting templates mastery
2. Decision documentation
3. Action item tracking
4. Repository organization

### For Security Officers
**Goal:** Implement and maintain security practices

1. Threat modeling
2. Security tier implementation
3. Incident response
4. Training others in OpSec

### For Coordinators
**Goal:** Manage multi-team workflows

1. Branch strategies
2. Merge conflict resolution
3. Federation setup
4. Performance monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Teaching Tools

### Hands-On Exercises
- **Meeting Minutes Challenge** - Document a mock meeting
- **Campaign Planning** - Use [Git Through Campaign](../teach/workshops/git-through-campaign.md) tutorial
- **Security Drill** - Practice incident response
- **Merge Conflict Party** - Make conflicts fun

### Visual Aids
- Git workflow diagrams
- Security model charts
- Before/after organizing comparisons
- Command reference cards

### Assessment Tools
- Skills checklists
- Practice scenarios
- Peer teaching exercises
- Real-world projects

## üìä Measuring Learning

### Individual Progress
- Can create and commit
- Can find information
- Can resolve conflicts
- Can teach another person

### Organizational Adoption
- % of meetings documented
- Average onboarding time
- Security incidents avoided
- Knowledge retention rate

## üéØ Common Teaching Scenarios

### "I'm Not Technical"
- Start with smartphones as computers
- Show Track Changes ‚Üí Git connection (see [Git isn't programming](../learn/git-basics/git-isnt-programming.md))
- Emphasize organizing skills they have
- Make first commit in 5 minutes

### "Too Complicated"
- Teach only [7 commands](../learn/git-basics/git-in-7-commands.md) first
- Use templates for everything
- GUI tools when helpful
- Gradual complexity increase

### "No Time to Learn"
- Calculate time lost to current methods
- Start with one workflow
- 15-minute daily practice
- Immediate practical value

### "Why Not Just Use Google?"
- Security awareness exercise
- Show surveillance examples (see [Migration from Google](../implement/getting-started/migration-guides/from-google-docs.md))
- Discuss organizational autonomy
- Connect to political values (see [why this matters](../start/why-druids.md))

## üèóÔ∏è Building Teaching Capacity

### Create Teacher Pairs
- Technical + Organizing expertise
- Rotate teaching duties
- Share preparation work
- Debrief after sessions

### Develop Local Materials
- Customize examples to your work
- Create organization-specific guides
- Document local workflows
- Share improvements upstream

### Establish Practice Culture
- Regular skill shares
- Troubleshooting parties
- Celebration of mistakes
- Continuous improvement

## üí° Teaching Tips

### Before the Session
- Test all technology
- Prepare real examples
- Have backup plans
- Create safe environment

### During the Session
- Go slower than feels comfortable
- Repeat key concepts
- Encourage questions
- Rotate who's typing

### After the Session
- Follow up within 24 hours
- Provide practice tasks
- Schedule check-ins
- Connect learners

## üöÄ Scaling Knowledge

### Documentation
- Record common questions
- Create FAQ documents
- Build troubleshooting guides
- Share teaching materials

### Peer Networks
- Connect new teachers
- Share successes/failures
- Coordinate curriculums
- Build resource library

### Continuous Improvement
- Gather feedback actively
- Iterate on materials
- Test new approaches
- Measure outcomes
