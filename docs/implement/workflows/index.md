# DRUIDS Workflows

Practical workflows for implementing DRUIDS across different organizing roles and scenarios. These workflows adapt to your organization's specific needs while maintaining democratic principles.

## Organizational Workflows

### [Meeting Workflow Guide](../../implement/workflows/meeting-workflow-guide.md)
Complete process for facilitating, documenting, and following up on organizational meetings using DRUIDS.

### [Proposal Process](../../implement/workflows/proposal-process.md)
Democratic decision-making workflow from initial idea to implementation tracking.

### [Project Management Guide](../../implement/workflows/project-management-guide.md)
Coordinate complex organizing projects across multiple teams and timelines.

### [Task Management](../../implement/workflows/task-management.md)
Distribute work, track progress, and maintain accountability without hierarchical oversight.

## Role-Specific Workflows

### [Git Workflows by Role](../../implement/workflows/git-workflows-by-role.md)
Customized Git practices for facilitators, security officers, coordinators, and new members.

### [Bus Factor Elimination](../../implement/workflows/bus-factor-elimination.md)
Ensure organizational continuity by eliminating single points of failure in knowledge and skills.

## Workflow Principles

### Democratic Process
- **Transparent Operations**: All workflow steps visible to organization
- **Collective Decision Making**: Major changes decided by group process
- **Rotating Responsibilities**: No permanent workflow gatekeepers
- **Accessible Participation**: Workflows designed for diverse skill levels

### Security Integration
- **Threat-Appropriate Measures**: Security scaled to organizational risk level
- **Operational Security**: Protect sensitive information throughout workflows
- **Incident Response**: Clear procedures for security breaches or disruption
- **Regular Assessment**: Ongoing evaluation of security effectiveness

### Organizational Sustainability
- **Knowledge Distribution**: No single person controls critical workflows
- **Skill Development**: Workflows build collective capacity over time
- **Adaptability**: Processes that evolve with organizational needs
- **Documentation**: Clear records of workflow decisions and changes

## Implementation Strategy

### Starting Small
1. **Choose One Workflow**: Begin with most urgent organizational need
2. **Pilot with Core Group**: Test with experienced, committed members
3. **Document Experience**: Record what works and what needs adjustment
4. **Expand Gradually**: Add workflows as capacity and confidence build

### Building Capacity
1. **Skill Sharing**: Teach workflows through collective practice
2. **Rotation System**: Ensure multiple people can facilitate each workflow
3. **Troubleshooting Knowledge**: Build collective problem-solving capacity
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular evaluation and refinement process

### Integration with Existing Practice
1. **Assess Current Workflows**: Understand what your organization already does well
2. **Identify Pain Points**: Focus on areas where current practice creates problems
3. **Gradual Transition**: Phase implementation to avoid disrupting effective work
4. **Cultural Alignment**: Ensure workflows support organizational values and culture

## Customization Guidelines

### Adapting to Context
- **Organizational Size**: Scale workflows for groups from 5 to 500+ members
- **Technical Capacity**: Adjust complexity based on collective technical skills
- **Security Needs**: Implement appropriate security measures for threat environment
- **Resource Availability**: Work within organizational time and equipment constraints

### Maintaining Principles
While customizing workflows:
- **Keep Democratic Process**: Don't sacrifice collective decision-making for efficiency
- **Preserve Transparency**: Maintain visibility of organizational operations
- **Build Collective Capacity**: Ensure workflows strengthen rather than weaken organization
- **Support Security**: Don't compromise safety for convenience
