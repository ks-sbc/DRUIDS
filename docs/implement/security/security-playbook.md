# Security Implementation Playbook

> **Real security for small revolutionary organizations** - Not paranoia, not theater, just practical protection against documented threats.

## Start Here: Your 2-Hour Security Workshop

### Part 1: Threat Model Reality Check (30 minutes)

**Exercise: List Your Actual Threats**

Get your core organizers together and honestly assess:

1. **Law Enforcement Threats**
   - Local police interest level (Low/Medium/High)
   - Federal attention (FBI, DHS, etc.)
   - Past raids or surveillance in your area
   - Legal vulnerabilities (arrests, warrants)

2. **Corporate/Employer Threats**
   - Members' job security risks
   - Corporate surveillance concerns
   - Industry-specific retaliation

3. **Internal Threats**
   - Burnout and single points of failure
   - Information silos
   - Personality conflicts
   - Potential infiltration

4. **Technical Threats**
   - Device seizure likelihood
   - Hacking sophistication needed
   - Social engineering risks

**Output**: Threat priority list (what keeps you up at night?)

### Part 2: Map Threats to Security Tiers (45 minutes)

Use this classification flowchart:

```
Is this information already public or meant to be?
    YES ‚Üí L0 (Green) - Public Tier
    NO ‚Üì

Would disclosure harm the organization but not individuals?
    YES ‚Üí L1 (Brown) - Member Tier  
    NO ‚Üì

Could this get someone arrested, fired, or physically harmed?
    YES ‚Üí L2 (Red) - Cadre Tier
```

**Common L0 (Public) Examples:**

- Educational materials
- Public event announcements
- Already-published positions
- General meeting minutes (sanitized)

**Common L1 (Member) Examples:**

- Internal discussions and debates
- Member contact information
- Financial records
- Strategic planning (non-sensitive)
- Meeting minutes (full version)

**Common L2 (Cadre) Examples:**

- Direct action planning
- Legal defense strategies
- Infiltration concerns
- Member vulnerabilities
- Anything involving illegality

### Part 3: Implement Practical Security (45 minutes)

**Immediate Actions (Do Today):**

1. **Password Audit**
   - List all organizational accounts
   - Identify who has access
   - Create password manager vault
   - Generate new strong passwords

2. **Communication Channels**
   - Public: Keep Discord/social media
   - Member: Move to DRUIDS L1 vault
   - Sensitive: Create L2 procedures

3. **Document Migration**
   - Export Google Docs
   - Sort by security tier
   - Import to appropriate vaults

**This Week Actions:**

1. **Device Security Basics**

   ```bash
   # Minimum viable security
   - Full disk encryption on all devices
   - Screen lock with password (not biometric)
   - Separate user accounts for DRUIDS work
   - Regular backups to encrypted drives
   ```

2. **Access Control Setup**
   - L0: Anyone can clone public repo
   - L1: Member onboarding checklist
   - L2: Strict need-to-know basis

3. **Visual Security Training**
   - Show green/brown/red borders
   - Practice classification exercises
   - Common mistakes workshop

## Raid/Legal Threat Procedures

### Before (Preparation)

**Technical Preparation:**

- L2 content NEVER on primary devices
- Use dedicated machines for sensitive work
- Enable full disk encryption everywhere
- Regular encrypted backups offsite

**Legal Preparation:**

- Know your rights card for all members
- Lawyer contact info distributed
- Legal fund established
- Power of attorney documents ready

**Organizational Preparation:**

- Clear roles during crisis
- Communication tree established
- Safe houses identified
- Document destruction protocols

### During (If Raid Happens)

**Immediate Response:**

1. **Stay Calm** - They want you panicked
2. **Invoke Rights** - "I am exercising my right to remain silent. I want a lawyer."
3. **Document Everything** - Have someone outside filming/noting
4. **Alert Network** - Use predetermined signal

**Technical Response:**

- Do NOT unlock devices
- Do NOT provide passwords
- Do NOT consent to searches
- Let encryption do its job

### After (Recovery)

**First 24 Hours:**

- Account for all members
- Legal team activated
- Security audit of what was taken
- Public statement if needed

**First Week:**

- Change all L1 passwords
- Rotate L2 access completely
- Debrief with membership
- Update security procedures

## Building Sustainable Security Culture

### Make It Visual, Not Verbal

‚ùå **Security Theater**:

- Complex passwords changed monthly
- Paranoid communication protocols
- Assuming everything is compromised
- Secret agent LARPing

‚úÖ **Real Security**:

- Visual indicators prevent mistakes
- Reasonable practices people follow
- Threat-appropriate responses
- Community accountability

### Regular Security Reviews (Monthly)

**10-Minute Security Check:**

1. Any new threats this month?
2. Any classification confusion?
3. Any close calls or mistakes?
4. Anyone need security support?

**Quarterly Deep Dive:**

- Review threat model changes
- Update access lists
- Practice incident response
- Refresh training materials

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-Classification**
   - Not everything is L2
   - Kills organizational transparency
   - Creates unnecessary barriers

2. **Under-Classification**
   - "It's probably fine" isn't security
   - One mistake can expose members
   - Visual indicators exist for a reason

3. **Security Theater**
   - Complexity doesn't equal security
   - Focus on real threats, not movie plots
   - Sustainability beats perfection

4. **Single Security Officer**
   - Creates new single point of failure
   - Burns out security-conscious members
   - Everyone needs basic knowledge

## Quick Reference Cards

### Classification Quick Card

```
PUBLIC (L0) üü¢
- Already published anywhere
- Educational materials
- Public positions

MEMBER (L1) üü§  
- Internal but not dangerous
- Meeting minutes
- Contact lists

CADRE (L2) üî¥
- Could harm individuals
- Legal vulnerabilities  
- Strategic secrets
```

### Daily Security Habits

```
Morning:
‚ñ° Check which vault you're in
‚ñ° Note visual indicators
‚ñ° Verify classification

Working:
‚ñ° Create in correct tier
‚ñ° Check before sharing
‚ñ° Use templates

Evening:
‚ñ° Commit changes
‚ñ° Lock screens
‚ñ° Backup if needed
```

## Getting Help

- **Not sure about classification?** Ask two other members
- **Think you made a mistake?** Tell someone immediately
- **Feeling overwhelmed?** Security is collective work
- **Need technical help?** See [Security Audits](security-audits-for-organizers.md)

Remember: Perfect security is impossible. Good-enough security that everyone actually follows will protect you better than complex systems that break down under pressure.
