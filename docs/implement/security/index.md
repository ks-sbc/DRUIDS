# Security Implementation

*Operational security protocols for revolutionary infrastructure*

## Overview

This section provides comprehensive security implementation guides for DRUIDS-based organizing. Security isn't paranoia - it's collective protection and strategic thinking.

## Core Security Documents

### Essential Protocols
- **[[security-playbook|Security Playbook]]** - Daily operational security practices
- **[[security-audits-for-organizers|Security Audits]]** - Regular security assessments
- **[[when-they-come-knocking|When They Come Knocking]]** - Crisis response protocols

### Data Protection
- **[[help-committed-sensitive-data|Committed Sensitive Data]]** - Emergency data scrubbing
- **[[git-history-scrubbing|Git History Scrubbing]]** - Technical history cleaning
- **[[metadata-stripping-pipeline|Metadata Stripping]]** - Automated data sanitization

## Security Model

### Three-Tier Information Architecture

**L0 (Public)**: Information we want widely accessible
- Public campaigns and education
- General organizing principles
- Open-source documentation

**L1 (Members)**: Information for committed organizers
- Internal strategy and planning
- Member contact information
- Tactical discussions

**L2 (Cadre)**: Information for core leadership
- Sensitive operations
- Security-critical planning
- Risk assessment details

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **[[security-playbook|Review Security Playbook]]**
2. **Set up encrypted communications**
3. **Establish pseudonym discipline**
4. **Configure basic operational security**

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. **[[security-audits-for-organizers|Conduct first security audit]]**
2. **Train all members on protocols**
3. **Implement L0/L1/L2 repository structure**
4. **Test crisis response procedures**

### Ongoing
1. **Regular security reviews**
2. **Update protocols based on threat changes**
3. **Continuous security education**
4. **Monitor for security incidents**

## Common Security Mistakes

### Individual vs. Collective Thinking
- **Mistake**: "I have nothing to hide"
- **Reality**: Your security affects everyone you organize with

### Technology Solutionism
- **Mistake**: "This app solves our security"
- **Reality**: Security requires practices, not just tools

### Operational Isolation
- **Mistake**: "Security is too complicated for new members"
- **Reality**: Good security culture includes everyone

## Threat Scenarios

### Surveillance
- **State monitoring** of public organizing
- **Corporate data mining** from platform use
- **Infiltrator information gathering**

### Response Protocols
- **Documentation practices** that assume monitoring
- **Communication protocols** for sensitive information
- **Digital hygiene** to minimize attack surface

### Repression
- **Legal harassment** and arrest
- **Workplace retaliation** for organizing
- **Community pressure** and isolation

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Compartmentalization** of sensitive information
- **Support networks** for targeted members
- **Legal resources** and know-your-rights training

## Getting Help

### Internal Resources
- Security team members
- Experienced organizers
- Peer support networks

### External Resources
- Digital security trainings
- Legal defense organizations
- Community security groups

### Crisis Support
- **[[when-they-come-knocking|Emergency protocols]]**
- **Legal hotlines and support**
- **Rapid response networks**

**Remember**: Security culture is love culture. We protect each other because we believe in our collective future.
