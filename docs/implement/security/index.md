# Security Implementation

*Operational security protocols for revolutionary infrastructure*

## Overview

This section provides comprehensive security implementation guides for DRUIDS-based organizing. Security isn't paranoia - it's collective protection and strategic thinking.

## Core Security Documents

### Essential Protocols
- **[Security Playbook](../../implement/security/security-playbook.md)** - Daily operational security practices
- **[Security Audits](security-audits-for-organizers.md)** - Regular security assessments
- **[When They Come Knocking](when-they-come-knocking.md)** - Crisis response protocols

### Data Protection
- **[Committed Sensitive Data](help-committed-sensitive-data.md)** - Emergency data scrubbing
- **[Git History Scrubbing](../../implement/security/git-history-scrubbing.md)** - Technical history cleaning
- **[Metadata Stripping](../../implement/security/metadata-stripping-pipeline.md)** - Automated data sanitization

## Security Model

### Three-Tier Information Architecture

**L0 (Public)**: Information we want widely accessible
- Public campaigns and education
- General organizing principles
- Open-source documentation

**L1 (Members)**: Information for committed organizers
- Internal strategy and planning
- Member contact information
- Tactical discussions

**L2 (Cadre)**: Information for core leadership
- Sensitive operations
- Security-critical planning
- Risk assessment details

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **[Review Security Playbook](../../implement/security/security-playbook.md)**
2. **Set up encrypted communications**
3. **Establish pseudonym discipline**
4. **Configure basic operational security**

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. **[Conduct first security audit](security-audits-for-organizers.md)**
2. **Train all members on protocols**
3. **Implement L0/L1/L2 repository structure**
4. **Test crisis response procedures**

### Ongoing
1. **Regular security reviews**
2. **Update protocols based on threat changes**
3. **Continuous security education**
4. **Monitor for security incidents**

## Common Security Mistakes

### Individual vs. Collective Thinking
- **Mistake**: "I have nothing to hide"
- **Reality**: Your security affects everyone you organize with

### Technology Solutionism
- **Mistake**: "This app solves our security"
- **Reality**: Security requires practices, not just tools

### Operational Isolation
- **Mistake**: "Security is too complicated for new members"
- **Reality**: Good security culture includes everyone

## Threat Scenarios

### Surveillance
- **State monitoring** of public organizing
- **Corporate data mining** from platform use
- **Infiltrator information gathering**

### Response Protocols
- **Documentation practices** that assume monitoring
- **Communication protocols** for sensitive information
- **Digital hygiene** to minimize attack surface

### Repression
- **Legal harassment** and arrest
- **Workplace retaliation** for organizing
- **Community pressure** and isolation

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Compartmentalization** of sensitive information
- **Support networks** for targeted members
- **Legal resources** and know-your-rights training

## Getting Help

### Internal Resources
- Security team members
- Experienced organizers
- Peer support networks

### External Resources
- Digital security trainings
- Legal defense organizations
- Community security groups

### Crisis Support
- **[Emergency protocols](when-they-come-knocking.md)**
- **Legal hotlines and support**
- **Rapid response networks**

**Remember**: Security culture is love culture. We protect each other because we believe in our collective future.
