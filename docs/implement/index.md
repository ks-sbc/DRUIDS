# Implementing DRUIDS

**Prerequisites**: Understand [why DRUIDS matters](../start/why-druids.md) and review [core concepts](../index.md) before implementation.

**Need help choosing a path?** Check [Visual Learning Paths](../learn/visual-roadmaps.md) for your organizing context.

## Choose Your Path

### ðŸš€ Getting Started
For organizations new to DRUIDS:

1. **[Installation Guide](../implement/getting-started/druids-installation-guide.md)** - Get DRUIDS running (15-45 minutes)
2. **[First Week with DRUIDS](../start/onboarding-yourself-in-3-days.md)** - Essential habits and workflows
3. **Migration Guides** - Move from your current tools:
   - [From Google Docs](../implement/getting-started/migration-guides/from-google-docs.md)
   - [From Discord](../implement/getting-started/migration-guides/from-discord.md)
   - [From Signal Groups](../learn/explanations/signal-isnt-enough.md)

### ðŸ’¼ Organizing Workflows
Daily operational guides:

- **[Meeting Management](../implement/workflows/meeting-workflow-guide.md)** - Minutes, decisions, and follow-up
- **[Campaign Tracking](../implement/workflows/project-management-guide.md)** - From planning to victory
- **[Member Onboarding](../learn/tutorials/onboarding-without-burnout.md)** - Self-service orientation
- **[Security Protocols](../implement/security/security-playbook.md)** - Operational security practices

### ðŸ”§ Advanced Implementation
For complex deployments:

- **Multi-Org Federation** - Connecting multiple chapters
- **[Custom Tails Images](../implement/advanced/custom-tails-image-technical-guide.md)** - Maximum security setup
- **[Automation Scripts](../implement/advanced/druids-tails-bootstrap-scripts.md)** - Streamline operations

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Install DRUIDS on test system
- [ ] Create first repository
- [ ] Document one meeting
- [ ] Set up basic security

### Week 2: Migration
- [ ] Export data from current platforms
- [ ] Import historical documents
- [ ] Train core team
- [ ] Establish workflows

### Week 3: Expansion
- [ ] Roll out to all members
- [ ] Implement security tiers
- [ ] Create templates
- [ ] Start daily use

### Week 4: Optimization
- [ ] Gather feedback
- [ ] Refine workflows
- [ ] Add automation
- [ ] Document lessons

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Small Cell (2-10 members)
- Single repository
- Basic security (L0/L1)
- Local sync or Syncthing
- Focus on meeting notes and decisions

### Medium Organization (10-50 members)
- Multiple repositories by function
- Full security tiers (L0/L1/L2)
- Tor hidden service for sync
- Committees with own workflows

### Large Federation (50+ members)
- Hub and spoke architecture
- Per-chapter repositories
- Automated security monitoring
- Dedicated infrastructure team

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

### Organizational Readiness
- [ ] Identified pain points DRUIDS will solve
- [ ] Leadership buy-in secured
- [ ] Training time allocated
- [ ] Security model chosen

### Technical Preparation
- [ ] Hardware requirements met
- [ ] Test environment ready
- [ ] Backup systems in place
- [ ] Network connectivity verified

### Human Factors
- [ ] Trainers identified
- [ ] Documentation customized
- [ ] Support channels established
- [ ] Success metrics defined

## Deployment Models

### 1. DRUIDS-Tails USB (Highest Security)
- Pre-configured USB sticks
- Air-gapped capability
- Tor-only networking
- Perfect forward secrecy

**Best for:** High-risk organizing, security-critical operations

### 2. Standard Installation (Balanced)
- Install on existing systems
- Encrypted repositories
- Mixed network modes
- Regular backups

**Best for:** Most organizations, daily organizing work

### 3. Cloud-Hybrid (Convenience)
- Local DRUIDS + encrypted cloud sync
- Easier multi-device access
- Some sovereignty traded for convenience
- Still no corporate surveillance

**Best for:** Distributed organizations, less sensitive work

## Success Factors

### Technical
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Test everything in safe environment first
- Have rollback plan ready
- Monitor adoption metrics

### Organizational
- Lead by example
- Celebrate small wins
- Address resistance directly
- Make it easier than old way

### Cultural
- Emphasize collective benefit
- Connect to revolutionary values
- Build habits slowly
- Share success stories

## Getting Help

### Documentation
- This guide
- [Troubleshooting](../implement/mkdocs/website-validations.md)
- Community Forums

### Training
- [Workshop Materials](../teach/workshops/git-through-campaign-template.md)
- [Train-the-Trainers](../teach/teach-tech-without-priest-hood.md)
- Peer support networks

### Technical Support
- GitHub issues
- Secure communication channels
- Community expertise

## Measuring Success

### Week 1 Metrics
- First successful commit
- One meeting documented
- All core members have access

### Month 1 Metrics  
- 80% of meetings in DRUIDS
- Onboarding time reduced
- No data on corporate platforms

### Month 3 Metrics
- Institutional memory building
- New members self-onboarding
- Security practices habitual

## Next Steps

1. **Choose deployment model** based on your needs
2. **Follow [installation guide](../implement/getting-started/druids-installation-guide.md)** for your chosen path
3. **Start with one workflow** (recommend [meeting notes](../implement/workflows/meeting-workflow-guide.md))
4. **Expand gradually** as comfort grows

**Ready to teach others?** Use our [workshop template](../teach/workshops/git-through-campaign-template.md) to spread knowledge.

**Need the theory?** Review [why this matters](../learn/core-concepts/institutional-memory.md) for organizing.
