# Democratic Centralism

- [ ] TODO: Finish writing this
- [ ] TODO: Format correctly


Democratic centralism is the foundational organizational principle underlying DRUIDS. It provides a framework for collective decision-making combined with unified action, balancing democratic participation with effective implementation.

## Core Principles

Democratic centralism is commonly misunderstood as a system of authoritarianism, but it is actually a system of democracy. Centralism and democracy are not opposites in contradiction, but they do exist in a dialectic relationship. Centralism relies upon democracy to remain abreast of the needs of the masses, to have accurate information, and to be able to make timely and effective decisions. Democracy relies on centralism for direction, guidance, and discipline. Centralism enhances democracy by providing the necessary structure to ensure that the will of the masses is properly represented and implemented.

### Freedom of Discussion

Before decisions are made, all members have the right and responsibility to contribute to discussions. Once a decision is reached democratically, all members implement it with discipline, regardless of their personal position during the debate.

### Unity of Action

Unity of action is the ability of the organization to move as one, to act in concert, to coordinate its actions, and to achieve its goals. It is the ability of the organization to move as one, to act in concert, to coordinate its actions, and to achieve its goals.

### Collective Decision-Making

After thorough discussion, majority decisions become binding on all members. The minority maintains the right to hold their views internally but must implement the majority decision in practice.

### Principled Criticisms

### Reports from the Rank and File

## How It Works in Practice

1. **Proposal Submission**

- Any member can submit proposals through defined channels
- Proposals must include rationale and implementation plans
- Security classification is assigned based on content

2. **Information Gathering**

- Relevant data and perspectives are collected
- Subject matter experts provide input
- Historical precedents are reviewed

3. **Ideological Struggle**

- Proposals are evaluated against organizational principles
- Members engage in structured discussion
- Different viewpoints are thoroughly explored

4. **Build Unity from Struggle**

- Common ground is identified
- Compromise positions may be developed
- Final proposals are refined

5. **Voting**

- Formal votes are conducted through secure channels
- Results are transparent to appropriate security levels
- Decisions are binding once made

6. **Implementation**

- Clear responsibilities are assigned
- Timelines and metrics are established
- All members work toward the decided goal

7. **Accountability**

- Progress is regularly reported
- Deviations are addressed through criticism/self-criticism
- Results are evaluated objectively

## Common Misconceptions

- **It's Authoritarian** - Democratic centralism requires MORE democracy than typical organizations, not less. Every decision involves genuine discussion before implementation.
- **It's Bureaucratic** - Properly implemented, it prevents bureaucracy by ensuring leadership remains accountable to membership through regular criticism/self-criticism.
- **It's Inflexible** - The system adapts to conditions. During high-security situations, it may emphasize centralism; during development periods, it may emphasize democracy.
- **It's Not Democratic** - Democratic centralism is a system of democracy, not a system of authoritarianism.

## Benefits for Organizations

1. **Clear Decision-Making**: No ambiguity about how decisions are made
2. **Unified Action**: Entire organization moves as one
3. **Accountability**: Leadership answerable to membership
4. **Security**: Natural compartmentalization of information
5. **Efficiency**: Decisions implemented without endless re-litigation
