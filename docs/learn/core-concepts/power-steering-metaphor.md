# The Power Steering Metaphor

## The Metaphor Explained

Think about power steering in a vehicle. It doesn't decide where you drive—it makes steering easier. Without it, you can still turn the wheel, but it requires more effort, especially at low speeds or when maneuvering in tight spaces. With it, the same movements achieve greater results with less strain.

DRUIDS is power steering for revolutionary organizing.

## What This Means Materially

### Without DRUIDS (Manual Steering)
- Every decision requires reconstructing context
- Knowledge lives in individual heads
- Coordination demands constant communication
- Security requires perfect individual discipline
- Growth means exponential complexity

### With DRUIDS (Power Steering)
- Context travels with decisions automatically
- Knowledge becomes collective infrastructure
- Coordination happens through structure
- Security becomes systematic practice
- Growth builds on preserved foundations

## The Key Insight

Power steering doesn't make decisions for the driver. It amplifies the driver's intentions, making them easier to execute. Similarly, DRUIDS doesn't dictate your organizing strategy—it makes your chosen strategy easier to implement.

## Common Misunderstandings

### "DRUIDS Will Organize For Us"
**Reality**: DRUIDS preserves and amplifies your organizing. Bad organizing with good tools is still bad organizing—just better documented.

### "Technology Determines Politics"
**Reality**: Infrastructure shapes possibilities, not outcomes. A hammer can build houses or break windows. The politics remain in the hands of users.

### "More Features = Better Organizing"
**Reality**: Power steering is simple infrastructure done well. Complexity often reduces rather than enhances capacity.

## Practical Applications

### Meeting Documentation
**Manual**: Someone takes notes, emails them, they get lost in inboxes
**Power Steering**: Notes committed, context preserved, searchable forever

### Campaign Planning
**Manual**: Recreate strategy each meeting, lose institutional memory
**Power Steering**: Build on preserved knowledge, see what worked before

### Security Practices
**Manual**: Rely on individual habits and discipline
**Power Steering**: Systematic practices built into workflows

### Onboarding New Members
**Manual**: Repeat everything, hope nothing gets missed
**Power Steering**: Self-guided paths through preserved knowledge

## The Political Implications

### Democratization vs. Hierarchy
Power steering is available to all drivers equally. Similarly, DRUIDS democratizes technical capacity rather than creating new hierarchies.

### Collective vs. Individual
Just as modern vehicles assume power steering as baseline infrastructure, revolutionary organizations need collective memory as baseline capacity.

### Sustainability vs. Burnout
Power steering reduces driver fatigue on long journeys. DRUIDS reduces organizer burnout by preserving rather than recreating knowledge.

## Design Principles

### 1. Amplify, Don't Automate
Enhance human judgment rather than replacing it

### 2. Invisible When Working
Good infrastructure disappears into practice

### 3. Equal Access
No special technical knowledge required

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
Work at any skill level, reward growth

### 5. Collective Benefit
Individual contributions strengthen everyone

## When Power Steering Matters Most

### High-Stress Situations
- Rapid response organizing
- Security incidents
- Coalition coordination
- Crisis management

### Long-Term Building
- Multi-year campaigns
- Institutional development
- Knowledge preservation
- Capacity building

### Scale Transitions
- Growing from 10 to 100 members
- Adding new chapters
- Federating organizations
- Coordinating regions

## Conclusion

DRUIDS as power steering means:
- Your organizing determines direction
- The infrastructure makes it easier
- Everyone benefits from collective capacity
- The technology serves the politics

The revolution doesn't need more complex tools. It needs simple infrastructure that amplifies collective capacity while preserving democratic control.
