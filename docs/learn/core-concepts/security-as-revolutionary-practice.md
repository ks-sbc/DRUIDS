# Security as Revolutionary Practice

*Security culture isn't paranoia - it's love for our movement and each other*

## The Revolutionary Framework

Security isn't about individual privacy or hiding from the world. It's about **protecting our collective capacity** to organize and build power.

### What Security Actually Protects

1. **Organizational Continuity**: Keeping our work alive when individual members face repression
2. **Strategic Advantage**: Maintaining initiative rather than reacting to state moves
3. **Community Trust**: Creating conditions where people feel safe to participate
4. **Future Organizing**: Preserving space for movements that don't yet exist

## Security Culture vs. Security Theater

### Security Culture (What We Want)
- **Collective Protection**: Everyone takes responsibility for group safety
- **Thoughtful Risk Assessment**: Understanding what we're protecting and why
- **Adaptive Practices**: Security measures that evolve with our work
- **Sustainable Habits**: Practices people can maintain long-term

### Security Theater (What to Avoid)
- **Individual Paranoia**: "Everyone is a cop" mentality that destroys trust
- **Rigid Rules**: Security practices divorced from actual threats
- **Technology Fetishism**: Believing tools alone provide security
- **Exclusionary Practices**: Security that keeps out the people we need

## The DRUIDS Security Model

### Three-Tier Information Architecture

**L0 (Public)**: Information we want widely accessible
- Public campaigns and education
- General organizing principles
- Open-source documentation

**L1 (Members)**: Information for committed organizers
- Internal strategy and planning
- Member contact information
- Tactical discussions

**L2 (Cadre)**: Information for core leadership
- Sensitive operations
- Security-critical planning
- Risk assessment details

### Operational Security Principles

1. **Compartmentalization**: People know what they need to know
2. **Need-to-Know**: Information shared based on role and necessity
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Systems that fail safely

## Digital Security as Political Education

### Why We Use Git Instead of Surveillance Platforms

**Google/Microsoft/Slack/Discord** extract value from our organizing:
- **Data Mining**: Our conversations become their product
- **Dependency**: We build organizing capacity on their infrastructure
- **Vulnerability**: They can shut us down at any time
- **Normalization**: We accept surveillance as the price of organizing

**Git-based systems** build our independent capacity:
- **Self-Hosting**: We control our own infrastructure
- **Transparency**: We can audit and modify our tools
- **Resilience**: Distributed systems are harder to destroy
- **Skills Building**: We develop technical capacity within our movement

### Teaching Security Through Practice

Security education works best when embedded in actual organizing work:

- **Meeting Documentation**: Practice good security while taking notes
- **Communication Protocols**: Develop secure habits through daily use  
- **Information Management**: Learn compartmentalization through real campaigns
- **Crisis Response**: Test security measures before we need them

## Common Security Mistakes

### Individual vs. Collective Thinking

**Mistake**: "I have nothing to hide, so I don't need security"
**Reality**: Your lack of security affects everyone you organize with

**Mistake**: "If they want to get us, they will"
**Reality**: Good security makes repression more expensive and visible

### Technology Solutionism

**Mistake**: "Signal solves our communication security"
**Reality**: Secure communication requires secure practices, not just secure apps

**Mistake**: "We need to get off all corporate platforms"
**Reality**: Security is about strategic trade-offs, not purity

### Operational Isolation

**Mistake**: "Security is too complicated for new members"
**Reality**: Security culture means everyone participates at their level

**Mistake**: "Only tech people can handle digital security"
**Reality**: Good security practices should be accessible to everyone

## Threat Modeling for Organizers

### Ask the Right Questions

1. **What are we protecting?**
   - Information, people, infrastructure, relationships

2. **Who are we protecting it from?**
   - State agencies, fascists, employers, landlords, tech companies

3. **How likely are different attacks?**
   - Surveillance, infiltration, doxxing, arrest, violence

4. **What happens if protection fails?**
   - Individual consequences vs. organizational damage

5. **What resources do we have for protection?**
   - Time, skills, money, infrastructure, allies

### Common Threat Scenarios

**Scenario**: Police monitoring public organizing
- **L0 Response**: Assume public work is monitored, focus on broad education
- **L1 Response**: Keep tactical discussions in secure channels
- **L2 Response**: Compartmentalize sensitive planning

**Scenario**: Fascist harassment and doxxing
- **Prevention**: Pseudonym discipline, careful photo practices
- **Response**: Community defense, platform security
- **Recovery**: Support systems, legal resources

**Scenario**: Employer retaliation for organizing
- **Prevention**: Separate work and organizing identities
- **Documentation**: Record retaliation for legal protection
- **Community**: Collective support for targeted members

## Building Security Culture

### Start With Why

Before teaching specific practices, help people understand:
- How security protects our collective work
- Why current practices create vulnerabilities
- How security culture builds trust and capacity

### Make It Practical

- **Integrate with real work**: Security practice during actual organizing
- **Start small**: Build habits gradually rather than overwhelming people
- **Show benefits**: Help people experience how good security improves organizing

### Address Fear and Resistance

**"This feels paranoid"**
→ "This is how we take care of each other"

**"It's too complicated"**
→ "We'll learn together, step by step"

**"I don't have anything worth protecting"**
→ "You have access to people and relationships that matter"

### Normalize Security Discussions

- Regular security check-ins at meetings
- Security topics in political education
- Celebrating good security practices
- Learning from security mistakes without shame

## Security as Revolutionary Infrastructure

### Building Independent Capacity

Every security practice should ask: "Does this make us more dependent on the system we're trying to change, or more capable of independent action?"

**Dependencies to Question**:
- Corporate communication platforms
- Centralized hosting services
- Proprietary software
- Single points of failure

**Capacities to Build**:
- Technical skills within our movement
- Distributed infrastructure
- Security expertise
- Crisis response capabilities

### Mutual Aid and Security

Security culture is mutual aid culture - we protect each other because we care about our collective liberation.

- **Skill Sharing**: Teaching security skills builds community capacity
- **Resource Sharing**: Helping comrades with security needs
- **Crisis Support**: Being there when security fails
- **Culture Building**: Normalizing care and protection practices

## Your Security Practice

### Personal Reflection Questions

1. **What organizing information do you have access to?**
2. **Who could be harmed if that information became public?**
3. **What are your current security habits?**
4. **Where are the gaps between your practices and your responsibilities?**
5. **What's one security improvement you could make this week?**

### Getting Started Actions

1. **Audit your current practices**: What information is where?
2. **Learn your organization's security culture**: What are the norms and expectations?
3. **Start small**: Pick one habit to improve
4. **Find learning partners**: Security is better learned collectively
5. **Practice in low-stakes situations**: Build habits before you need them
