# Tech Democratization as Class Struggle

*Or: Why Teaching Git to Comrades is More Revolutionary Than Any App You'll Build at Google*

## The Material Reality of Tech Gatekeeping

In Silicon Valley, a junior developer makes more than a teacher with 20 years experience. A mid-level engineer out-earns most lawyers. Senior developers live like petty bourgeoisie - stock options, property ownership, insulation from precarity.

This isn't accident. It's design.

Capital pays tech workers well not because we're smarter (we're not) or work harder (we don't). Capital pays us to maintain artificial scarcity of technical knowledge. We are, in Marxist terms, a labor aristocracy - workers whose material interests align with capital against the broader working class.

## The Contradiction of the Progressive Tech Worker

Here's the painful irony: Many tech workers genuinely want revolutionary change. We see surveillance capitalism. We know our code oppresses. We want to help.

But our help often looks like:
- Building another "revolutionary" app
- Donating to causes (charity, not solidarity)
- "Volunteering" our skills (maintaining hierarchy)
- Creating tools "for" movements (not with them)

We remain the priests. Others remain the congregation. The fundamental relationship - technical haves and have-nots - stays intact.

## DRUIDS-Tails: Annihilating Privilege Through Practice

The DRUIDS-Tails project represents something different: **the deliberate destruction of technical privilege through knowledge transfer**.

Consider what we're doing:
1. Taking enterprise-grade security (Tails)
2. Adding collaborative infrastructure (Obsidian + Git)
3. Making it boot-from-USB simple
4. Teaching it without jargon
5. **Giving away the very knowledge that makes us "valuable"**

This isn't charity. It's class suicide in the best sense - the voluntary dissolution of our privileged position.

## Why Capital Fears Accessible Tech

When we teach a tenant organizer to use Git, we're not just teaching commands. We're:

- **Breaking dependency** - They no longer need us
- **Demystifying power** - "Tech" stops being magical
- **Building capacity** - Organizations become self-sufficient
- **Spreading capability** - Each person teaches others
- **Undermining hierarchy** - No more "tech person" bottleneck

A revolutionary movement that can't secure its communications is doomed. A movement that depends on a few tech priests is vulnerable. But a movement where every organizer can deploy secure infrastructure? That terrifies capital.

## The Labor Aristocracy's Revolutionary Duty

Lenin wrote about how labor aristocracy, bribed by imperial super-profits, becomes a brake on revolution. Tech workers are the modern epitome - paid with wealth extracted globally, comfortable enough to never rebel.

But our position also gives us unique capability:
- We understand the tools of oppression
- We have time and resources to teach
- We can translate between worlds
- We can strip away artificial complexity

**Our revolutionary duty is to make ourselves obsolete.**

## Beyond Individual Solutions

This isn't about individual tech workers feeling guilty or "doing their part." It's about recognizing that:

1. **Technical knowledge is politically hoarded** - not naturally scarce
2. **Democratizing tech is class struggle** - not charity
3. **Teaching is more radical than coding** - it multiplies capacity
4. **Documentation is revolutionary infrastructure** - it persists beyond individuals

## The Tails + DRUIDS Model

Look at what we've built:

### Traditional Tech Approach
- "I'll build you a secure system"
- Complex, requires ongoing maintenance
- Organization depends on tech person
- Knowledge remains concentrated

### DRUIDS-Tails Approach
- "Here's a USB that boots to security"
- Simple enough for anyone
- Organization gains independence
- Knowledge spreads virally

The second approach eliminates the tech worker's special position. That's the point.

## Material Impact on Organizing

When every organizer can:
- Communicate securely without help
- Preserve institutional memory
- Share documents safely
- Collaborate asynchronously
- Work without central IT

Then:
- No single point of failure
- No technical bottleneck
- No waiting for "the tech person"
- No hierarchy based on skills
- No surveillance vulnerabilities

This is prefigurative politics - building the relations we want to see.

## The Harder Truth About Documentation

Writing documentation is unglamorous. It doesn't pay well. VCs don't fund it. Your GitHub profile doesn't showcase it. 

But teaching Git through tenant organizing examples does more for revolution than any venture-backed startup. Creating USB drives that boot to security spreads more freedom than any app.

Because it transfers power instead of hoarding it.

## A Personal Note from a Class Traitor

I make good money knowing things that should be common knowledge. My comfort comes from artificial scarcity of information. Every day I don't teach what I know, I'm choosing personal benefit over collective liberation.

The DRUIDS project is one attempt to resolve this contradiction - using privilege to undermine privilege, using knowledge to democratize knowledge.

It's not enough. It's never enough. But it's material action against the structures that create tech aristocracy.

## The Call to Action

If you're a tech worker reading this:

1. **Stop building apps** - Start teaching skills
2. **Stop "volunteering" expertise** - Start transferring knowledge  
3. **Stop maintaining systems** - Start documenting them
4. **Stop being the expert** - Start creating experts
5. **Stop hoarding knowledge** - Start giving it away

If you're an organizer reading this:

1. **Demand education, not service** from tech comrades
2. **Learn fearlessly** - It's not as hard as they pretend
3. **Teach others immediately** - Break the chain of dependency
4. **Build infrastructure collectively** - No more single points of failure

## The Future We're Building

Imagine:
- Every organization runs its own secure infrastructure
- Every organizer understands the tools they use
- Technical knowledge is as common as literacy
- "Tech support" is mutual aid, not hierarchy
- Digital security is universal, not elite

This future requires tech workers to commit class suicide by teaching ourselves out of privilege. It requires organizers to reject the comfortable position of "non-technical" learned helplessness.

## Conclusion: The Revolutionary Act

In the end, the most revolutionary thing a tech worker can do isn't to code for the movement. It's to teach the movement to code - or better yet, to show them they already can.

Every USB drive loaded with DRUIDS-Tails is a small act of class warfare. Every organizer who learns Git is a victory against artificial hierarchy. Every piece of radical documentation undermines the structures capital uses to divide us.

The revolution doesn't need more apps. It needs more teachers.

The revolution doesn't need tech priests. It needs tech literacy.

The revolution doesn't need our charity. It needs our obsolescence.
