# Core Concepts

These foundational concepts explain why DRUIDS exists and how it approaches revolutionary infrastructure differently.

## Essential Reading Order

### 1. [[institutional-memory|Institutional Memory]]
Understanding the material problem: organizations hemorrhage knowledge when people leave. This document explores why this happens and how DRUIDS addresses it systematically.

### 2. [[democratic-centralism|Democratic Centralism in Practice]]
How Git accidentally implements the organizational principle of democratic centralism - freedom of discussion, unity of action, with preserved dissent.

### 3. [[druids-security-implementation|Security as Revolutionary Practice]]
Security isn't about paranoia or checklists - it's about material threat assessment and collective practices that protect without paralyzing organizing.

### 4. [[three-tier-system|Three-Tier Security Model]]
The practical implementation of graduated security: L0 (public), L1 (members), L2 (sensitive). Based on real threat models, not security theater.

### 5. [[tech-democratization-as-class-struggle|Tech Democratization as Class Struggle]]
Why teaching Git to organizers is an act of class warfare against the technical labor aristocracy. Knowledge hoarding maintains hierarchy.

## Connecting Concepts

These concepts interconnect:

- **Institutional memory** requires **democratic processes** to be preserved meaningfully
- **Security practices** must serve **organizing needs**, not vice versa
- **Technical knowledge** must be **democratized** to prevent new hierarchies
- **Infrastructure** must **embody our politics**, not just serve them

## The Power Steering Metaphor

DRUIDS doesn't provide ideology or direction - that comes from your revolutionary politics. DRUIDS makes the journey easier:

- **Ideology** = Your compass (Marxism-Leninism, anarchism, etc.)
- **Destination** = Your goal (liberation, communism, abolition, etc.)
- **DRUIDS** = Power steering (same journey, less exhaustion)

## Key Principles

### 1. Material Analysis First
Every feature addresses a real organizing problem, not theoretical concerns.

### 2. Democracy in Architecture  
Technical structures should reinforce democratic practices, not create hierarchies.

### 3. Security Through Clarity
Clear threat models and practical responses, not paranoid fantasy.

### 4. Knowledge as Commons
Information wants to be free - from both price and hierarchy.

### 5. Practice Over Purity
Working solutions beat perfect theories every time.

## Common Misconceptions

**"DRUIDS is just Git with politics"**  
Git is one tool in the system. DRUIDS is the integration of multiple tools with workflows designed for organizing.

**"This will make us revolutionary"**  
No. Your politics make you revolutionary. DRUIDS helps you organize better.

**"It's too technical for organizers"**  
If organizers can use smartphones, they can use DRUIDS. Complexity is a choice, not a requirement.

**"Security features will slow us down"**  
Good security speeds up organizing by preventing catastrophic failures.

## Questions for Reflection

As you read through these concepts, consider:

1. What knowledge has your organization already lost?
2. How does your current tech setup reinforce hierarchies?
3. What would change if every member could access all decisions?
4. How much time do you waste on repetitive explanations?
5. Who holds power through technical knowledge in your group?

## Next Steps

After understanding these core concepts:

1. **[Learn Git Basics](../git-basics/)** - Practical skills without programming
2. **[Explore DRUIDS Features](../druids-fundamentals/)** - What makes DRUIDS unique
3. **[Plan Implementation](../../implement/)** - Bring theory into practice

*"Theory without practice is sterile. Practice without theory is blind. DRUIDS connects both."*
