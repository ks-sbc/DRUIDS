# Onboarding New Members Without Burnout

## Overview

Traditional onboarding burns out experienced organizers through repetitive explanations, inconsistent information, and emotional labor. This guide shows how to create systematic onboarding that welcomes new comrades effectively while preserving organizer capacity.

## Prerequisites

- DRUIDS repository with basic structure
- Templates for common documents
- 2-3 hours for initial setup
- Commitment to systematic vs heroic onboarding

## Basic Onboarding System

### 1. Create Self-Service Onboarding Path

Stop repeating yourself. Build once, welcome many.

```bash
# Create onboarding structure
mkdir -p docs/onboarding/{week-1,week-2,week-3}
touch docs/onboarding/README.md
touch docs/onboarding/checklist.md
```

**docs/onboarding/README.md**:
```markdown
# Welcome to [Organization Name]!

You're joining a revolutionary organization committed to [mission].
This guide helps you get oriented without overwhelming anyone.

## Your First Day
1. Read our [[principles|Principles & Unity]]
2. Set up your [[druids-setup|DRUIDS access]]
3. Introduce yourself in [[introductions|introductions]]

## Your First Week
Follow the [[checklist|Week 1 Checklist]]

## Questions?
- Technical: Check [[faqs|FAQs]] first
- Political: Attend Thursday education
- Personal: Your buddy is **[assigned buddy]**

Remember: Asking questions after reading docs = good
Asking questions instead of reading docs = burnout
```

### 2. Implement Buddy System (Not Mentor System)

Distribute emotional labor, prevent hero dynamics.

```bash
# Track buddy assignments
touch members/buddy-rotation.md
```

**members/buddy-rotation.md**:
```markdown
# Buddy System Rotation

## Current Assignments
| New Member | Buddy | Started | Notes |
|------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Alex K. | Sam L. | 2024-03-15 | Week 2 |
| Jordan P. | River B. | 2024-03-20 | Just started |

## Rotation Schedule
- Each buddy takes ONE new member at a time
- 3-week commitment
- Minimum 1 month break between assignments
- Track burnout: anyone can skip rotation

## Buddy Responsibilities (LIMITED!)
- [ ] Weekly 30-min check-in
- [ ] Answer questions AFTER they read docs
- [ ] Connect to relevant working groups
- [ ] Flag any concerns to membership

NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR:
- Daily availability
- Teaching everything
- Emotional counseling
- Making them feel included (that's collective work)
```

### 3. Automate Routine Communications

Stop writing the same emails.

```bash
# Create template emails
mkdir -p templates/onboarding/emails
```

**templates/onboarding/emails/welcome.md**:
```markdown
Subject: Welcome to [Org] - Your First Steps

Comrade [Name],

Welcome! We're excited you're joining our struggle for [mission].

**Your Next Steps:**
1. Access your onboarding guide: [link to repo]
2. Read Week 1 materials (2 hours total)
3. Your buddy [Buddy Name] will reach out within 48 hours

**Key Dates:**
- Thursday 7pm: Political Education (optional but encouraged)
- Sunday 3pm: New Member Orientation
- [Date]: Next General Meeting

**Important:** Our onboarding is self-directed. The repository has 
answers to 90% of first questions. Reading first = respecting capacity.

In solidarity,
[Membership Secretary]

P.S. If you have access issues, email tech@[org].org
```

### 4. Progressive Security Clearance

Don't overwhelm with security, build trust gradually.

```bash
# Create security levels docs
mkdir -p docs/onboarding/security-levels
```

**Week 1: Basic Security**
```markdown
## Week 1 Security Practices

### Required:
- [ ] Use Signal for communications
- [ ] Create organizing pseudonym
- [ ] Read [[basic|Basic Security]]

### Not Yet:
- Don't worry about encryption beyond Signal
- No access to sensitive campaign info yet
- Focus on building trust first
```

**Week 3: Enhanced Security**
```markdown
## Week 3 Security Practices

After demonstrating consistency:
- [ ] GPG key generation workshop
- [ ] Metadata hygiene training  
- [ ] Access to L1 repositories

Remember: Security is collective practice, not individual paranoia
```

## Advanced Onboarding Systems

### 1. Self-Service Learning Portal

Create a fully automated onboarding system that requires zero hand-holding.

```bash
# Create interactive onboarding portal
mkdir -p onboarding-portal/{modules,progress,resources}
```

Save as `onboarding-portal/index.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>New Member Portal</title>
    <style>
        .module { border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; margin: 10px; }
        .completed { background-color: #90EE90; }
        .locked { opacity: 0.5; pointer-events: none; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to [Organization] Self-Service Portal</h1>
    
    <div id="progress">
        <h2>Your Progress: <span id="percent">0</span>%</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div id="modules">
        <div class="module" data-week="1">
            <h3>Week 1: Foundation</h3>

                <li><input type="checkbox" onchange="updateProgress()"> Complete security basics</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="module locked" data-week="2">
            <h3>Week 2: Integration</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><input type="checkbox" onchange="updateProgress()"> Attend first meeting</li>
                <li><input type="checkbox" onchange="updateProgress()"> Shadow working group</li>
                <li><input type="checkbox" onchange="updateProgress()"> Complete skills assessment</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="module locked" data-week="3">
            <h3>Week 3: Contribution</h3>

                <li><input type="checkbox" onchange="updateProgress()"> Help newer member</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <script>
        function updateProgress() {
            const total = document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]').length;
            const checked = document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]:checked').length;
            const percent = Math.round((checked / total) * 100);
            document.getElementById('percent').textContent = percent;
            
            // Unlock next module when previous is complete
            const modules = document.querySelectorAll('.module');
            modules.forEach((module, index) => {
                const inputs = module.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]');
                const moduleChecked = module.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]:checked');
                
                if (inputs.length === moduleChecked.length && index < modules.length - 1) {
                    modules[index + 1].classList.remove('locked');
                    module.classList.add('completed');
                }
            });
            
            // Save progress to localStorage
            localStorage.setItem('onboarding-progress', percent);
        }
        
        // Load saved progress
        window.onload = function() {
            const saved = localStorage.getItem('onboarding-progress');
            if (saved) {
                document.getElementById('percent').textContent = saved;
            }
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. Automated Check-in Bot

Stop manually checking on new members.

Save as `scripts/onboarding-bot.py`:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Automated onboarding check-in bot"""

import json
import datetime
from pathlib import Path

class OnboardingBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.members_file = Path("members/onboarding-status.json")

    def load_members(self):
        if self.members_file.exists():
            with open(self.members_file) as f:
                self.members = json.load(f)
        else:
            self.members = {}

        days_since_start = (datetime.date.today() - 
                           datetime.date.fromisoformat(member["start_date"])).days

    # Check progress
    print(bot.check_progress("Alex K"))
    
    # Generate report
    print(bot.generate_weekly_report())
```

### 3. Knowledge Prerequisite Tracking

Prevent repeated explanations through systematic learning.

```yaml
# onboarding/prerequisites.yml
learning_paths:
  technical_track:
    modules:
      - id: git_basics
        name: "Git Fundamentals"
        duration: "2 hours"
        prerequisites: []
        resources:
          - type: video
            url: "videos/git-basics.mp4"
          - type: text
            url: "docs/git-quick-start.md"
          - type: interactive
            url: "tutorials/git-playground"
        assessment:
          type: "practical"
          task: "Make first commit to sandbox repo"
          
      - id: druids_setup
        name: "DRUIDS Installation"
        duration: "1 hour"
        prerequisites: ["git_basics"]
        resources:
          - type: guide
            url: "docs/druids-setup.md"
        assessment:
          type: "checklist"
          items:
            - "DRUIDS installed"
            - "Can access repository"
            - "Made test edit"
            
  organizing_track:
    modules:
      - id: consensus_basics
        name: "Consensus Process"
        duration: "90 minutes"
        prerequisites: []
        resources:
          - type: video
            url: "videos/consensus-explained.mp4"
          - type: reading
            url: "theory/consensus-democracy.pdf"
        assessment:
          type: "quiz"
          passing_score: 80
          
      - id: meeting_facilitation
        name: "Facilitate Meetings"
        duration: "3 hours"
        prerequisites: ["consensus_basics"]
        resources:
          - type: workshop
            url: "workshops/facilitation-skills"
        assessment:
          type: "observation"
          task: "Co-facilitate one meeting"

# Progress tracking
member_progress:
  "alex_k":
    completed_modules: ["git_basics", "consensus_basics"]
    current_module: "druids_setup"
    started_date: "2024-03-15"
    track: "technical_track"
```

### 2. Cohort Onboarding

Build solidarity between new members.

```markdown
## Monthly New Member Cohorts

### Benefits:
- New members support each other
- Efficient use of trainer time
- Built-in accountability partners
- Reduces isolation

### Structure:
Week 1: Individual study + buddy check-ins
Week 2: Cohort meeting - share learnings
Week 3: Shadow experienced organizers
Week 4: First contribution with support
```

### 3. Contribution Pathways

Clear routes from observer to organizer.

```markdown
# Contribution Pathway Map

## Observer → Contributor (Weeks 1-2)
- Attend meetings as observer
- Read documentation
- Ask questions in appropriate channels

## Contributor → Organizer (Weeks 3-4)
- Take notes at one meeting
- Help with simple tasks
- Join a working group

## Organizer → Leader (Months 2-6)
- Bottom-line a project
- Facilitate meetings
- Mentor new members
```

### 4. Automated Progress Tracking

Know who needs what without asking.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/check-onboarding-progress.sh

MEMBER=$1
echo "Checking progress for $MEMBER"

# Check completed items
git log --author="$MEMBER" --pretty=format:"%s" | grep "COMPLETED"

# Check current week
DAYS_SINCE_JOIN=$(( ($(date +%s) - $(date -d "$(git log --author="$MEMBER" --reverse --pretty=format:%ad | head -1)" +%s)) / 86400 ))
CURRENT_WEEK=$(( $DAYS_SINCE_JOIN / 7 + 1 ))

echo "Currently in week $CURRENT_WEEK of onboarding"
```

## Understanding Output

### Healthy Onboarding Metrics

Track sustainability, not just speed:

```bash
# Burnout indicators
- Same 3 people doing all orientations
- Buddies extending past 3 weeks
- New members texting buddies constantly

# Health indicators  
- Onboarding duty rotates among 10+ people
- 80% questions answered by docs
- New members helping newer members by week 4
```

### Success Measurements

What good onboarding produces:

```
Traditional: "Sarah is amazing at onboarding!"
Systematic: "New members are contributing by week 3"

Traditional: "Text me with any questions!"
Systematic: "Check docs, then ask in #questions"

Traditional: 90% retention, 3 burnt organizers
Systematic: 75% retention, sustainable process
```

## Customization

### Organization-Specific Pathways

Create tracks for different entry points:

```markdown
# onboarding/pathways/

student-organizer.md
- Campus-specific resources
- Academic calendar considerations
- Age-appropriate security culture

workplace-organizer.md  
- Labor law resources
- Boss retaliation prep
- Scheduling around shifts

community-organizer.md
- Neighborhood mapping
- Local government structure
- Coalition building
```

### Cultural & Language Adaptation

Make onboarding accessible:

```bash
# Multilingual support
docs/onboarding/
  en/
  es/
  zh/
  
# Cultural considerations
onboarding/cultural-notes/
  immigrant-rights-focus.md
  indigenous-protocols.md
  religious-considerations.md
```

## Performance

### Reducing Time-to-Contribution

Goals for efficient onboarding:

- Week 1: Can navigate resources
- Week 2: Attends first meeting
- Week 3: Takes on first task
- Week 4: Helps someone newer

### Scaling Considerations

As organization grows:

```markdown
## 10-30 members
- Individual buddies work fine
- Monthly orientations

## 30-100 members  
- Need cohort system
- Automated check-ins
- Working group specialization

## 100+ members
- Multiple onboarding tracks
- Dedicated onboarding committee
- Regional/chapter variations
```

## Troubleshooting

### "New members still aren't reading docs"

**Solution**: Make reading mandatory
```markdown
## Orientation Agenda
1. Did you read Week 1 docs? (Y/N)
   - If No: Here's 30 minutes to read
   - If Yes: Let's discuss questions
```

### "Buddies getting overwhelmed"

**Solution**: Enforce boundaries
```markdown
## Buddy Boundaries
- 30 minutes/week MAX
- Questions via weekly thread, not DMs
- "Read docs first" is caring response
- Can hand off if overwhelmed
```

### "Onboarding feels impersonal"

**Solution**: Automate logistics, humanize connection
- Automate: Access, schedules, resources
- Humanize: Stories, struggles, solidarity
- Templates handle information
- Humans handle relationships

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ✓ Create self-directed pathways
- ✓ Rotate onboarding duties
- ✓ Track progress systematically
- ✓ Build cohort connections
- ✓ Enforce sustainable boundaries
- ✓ Celebrate first contributions

### DON'T:
- ✗ Make one person "onboarding guru"
- ✗ Repeat same info individually
- ✗ Skip documentation "to save time"
- ✗ Overwhelm with everything at once
- ✗ Tolerate boundary violations
- ✗ Rush security practices

## Gradual Integration Patterns

### The Permission Ladder

Prevent overwhelm through progressive access:

```yaml
# access-levels.yml
week_1:
  name: "Observer"
  permissions:
    - read: public_docs
    - join: orientation_channel
    - attend: public_meetings
  restrictions:
    - no_voting
    - no_financial_access
    - no_member_directory

week_2:
  name: "Participant"  
  permissions:
    - write: introductions
    - join: new_member_cohort
    - submit: first_task
  restrictions:
    - no_sensitive_data
    - no_facilitating

week_4:
  name: "Contributor"
  permissions:
    - vote: working_groups
    - access: member_directory
    - create: proposals
  restrictions:
    - no_financial_decisions
    - no_security_access

week_8:
  name: "Full Member"
  permissions:
    - vote: all_decisions
    - access: L1_security
    - facilitate: meetings
  restrictions:
    - standard_security_practices
```

### Automated Access Management

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# manage-access.py

import datetime
import subprocess

def update_member_access(member_name, start_date):
    """Automatically grant permissions based on time"""
    
    weeks_active = (datetime.date.today() - 
                   datetime.date.fromisoformat(start_date)).days // 7
    
    if weeks_active >= 8:
        level = "full_member"
    elif weeks_active >= 4:
        level = "contributor"
    elif weeks_active >= 2:
        level = "participant"
    else:
        level = "observer"
    
    # Update Git permissions
    subprocess.run([
        "git", "config", f"user.{member_name}.level", level
    ])
    
    # Update channel access
    update_signal_permissions(member_name, level)
    
    # Update repository access
    update_repo_access(member_name, level)
    
    return f"{member_name} updated to {level}"

def generate_access_report():
    """Weekly access audit"""
    report = "# Access Level Audit\n\n"
    
    # Check all members
    members = get_all_members()
    
    for member in members:
        level = get_member_level(member)
        report += f"- {member}: {level}\n"
    
    return report
```

## Automated FAQ System

Stop answering the same questions:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# faq-bot.py

import re
from datetime import datetime

class FAQBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.faqs = {
            r"meeting|when|schedule": {
                "answer": "Meetings are Thursdays 7pm. Calendar: [link]",

## Zero-Touch Onboarding Metrics

Track success without manual work:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# onboarding-metrics.sh

echo "=== Onboarding Health Metrics ==="
echo "Generated: $(date)"
echo ""

# Time to first contribution
echo "Average time to first commit:"
for member in $(cat members/new-last-90-days.txt); do
    first_commit=$(git log --author="$member" --reverse --format="%ad" | head -1)
    join_date=$(grep "$member" members/join-dates.txt | cut -d: -f2)
    days_to_commit=$(( ($(date -d "$first_commit" +%s) - $(date -d "$join_date" +%s)) / 86400 ))
    echo "$member: $days_to_commit days"
done | awk '{sum+=$2; count++} END {print sum/count " days average"}'

# Buddy load distribution
echo -e "\nBuddy workload (last 30 days):"
grep -c "buddy:" members/assignments.txt | sort -rn

# Self-service success rate
echo -e "\nQuestions in #help channel:"
last_month=$(grep "$(date -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m)" logs/help-channel.log | wc -l)
this_month=$(grep "$(date +%Y-%m)" logs/help-channel.log | wc -l)
echo "Last month: $last_month"
echo "This month: $this_month"
reduction=$(( (last_month - this_month) * 100 / last_month ))
echo "Reduction: $reduction%"

# Retention by cohort
echo -e "\nRetention rates:"
for cohort in q1-2024 q2-2024 q3-2024; do
    started=$(wc -l < cohorts/$cohort/started.txt)
    active=$(wc -l < cohorts/$cohort/still-active.txt)
    rate=$(( active * 100 / started ))
    echo "$cohort: $rate% ($active/$started)"
done
```

## Real Example

Here's how one organization transformed onboarding:

**Before**: 
- Marcus spent 10 hours/week onboarding
- Information inconsistent between buddies
- 50% dropped out from overwhelm
- Organizers burning out

**Implementation Timeline**:

### Phase 1: Documentation Sprint (Week 1)
```bash
# Document everything once
git checkout -b sustainable-onboarding
mkdir -p docs/onboarding/{week-1,week-2,week-3}

# Created core documents
- principles-and-values.md
- technical-setup-guide.md  
- meeting-culture.md
- security-basics.md
- contribution-pathways.md

# Built FAQ from common questions
grep "?" chat-logs/last-6-months.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn > common-questions.txt
```

### Phase 2: Automation Setup (Week 2)
```bash
# Set up self-service portal
cp templates/onboarding-portal.html public/onboard/

# Deploy check-in bot
python3 scripts/onboarding-bot.py --init

# Create cohort structure
mkdir -p cohorts/2024-Q2/{materials,progress}
```

### Phase 3: Pilot Program (Week 3)
- 5 new members in first cohort
- 2 buddies on rotation
- Tracked every question to improve docs
- Daily check-ins on process

### Phase 4: Full Rollout (Week 4)
```bash
# Announce new system
git commit -m "Launch sustainable onboarding system"

# Train buddies on boundaries
- 30 min/week maximum
- Point to docs first
- Escalate only if needed

# Monitor metrics
watch -n 3600 ./onboarding-metrics.sh
```

**After 6 Months**:
- Onboarding distributed among 12 people
- Each buddy spends 30 min/week max
- 75% retention (up from 50%)
- New members help newer members by week 4
- 90% questions answered by documentation
- Zero burnout from onboarding duty

## Next Steps

1. Create your onboarding directory structure
2. Write your Week 1 checklist
3. Set up buddy rotation schedule
4. Draft welcome email template
5. Test with next new member

Remember: Every hour spent on systematic onboarding saves 10 hours of repeated explanation. Sustainability isn't just self-care - it's revolutionary discipline.

*"The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall."* - Che

But you can't make it fall if you're burnt out from explaining Signal setup for the 50th time.
