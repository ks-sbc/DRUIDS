# Your DRUIDS Learning Path

## Where to Start

This learning path is designed to take you from "what is this?" to "I can teach others." Choose your starting point based on your current knowledge and needs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Navigation

### Brand New to Everything?
Start with **[Core Concepts](./core-concepts/)** to understand the fundamental problems DRUIDS solves and why it matters for revolutionary organizing.

### Familiar with Organizing, New to Git?
Jump to **[Git Basics](./git-basics/)** - we teach Git specifically for organizers, not programmers.

### Already Using Git?
Go directly to **[DRUIDS Fundamentals](./druids-fundamentals/)** to learn what makes DRUIDS different from generic Git usage.

### Ready to Implement?
Head to **[Implementation](../implement/)** for practical deployment guides.

## ðŸ“š Complete Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

#### Core Concepts
Understand the revolutionary theory behind DRUIDS:

1. **[[core-concepts/institutional-memory|Institutional Memory]]** - Why organizations hemorrhage knowledge
2. **[[core-concepts/democratic-centralism|Democratic Centralism in Practice]]** - How infrastructure shapes politics  
3. **[[core-concepts/druids-security-implementation|Security as Revolutionary Practice]]** - First principles, not checklists
4. **[[core-concepts/power-steering-metaphor|Power Steering Metaphor]]** - DRUIDS amplifies, doesn't direct

**Time:** 2-3 hours reading, 1 hour discussion

### Phase 2: Git for Organizers (Week 2)

Learn version control through organizing examples:

1. **[[git-basics/git-isnt-programming|Git Isn't Programming]]** - Destroy the intimidation
2. **[[git-basics/why-revolutionaries-need-git|Why Revolutionaries Need Git]]** - Material benefits
3. **[[git-basics/git-through-campaign|Git Through a Campaign]]** - Learn by following a rent strike
4. **[[git-basics/git-in-7-commands|Git in 7 Commands]]** - 90% of what you need

**Time:** 4-5 hours practice, 2 hours exercises

### Phase 3: DRUIDS Specifics (Week 3)

What makes DRUIDS different from plain Git:

1. **[[core-concepts/three-tier-system|Three-Tier Security Model]]** - L0/L1/L2 implementation
2. **[[druids-fundamentals/revolutionary-commit-conventions|Revolutionary Commit Conventions]]** - Encoding democracy
3. **[[druids-fundamentals/obsidian-integration|Obsidian Integration]]** - User-friendly interface
4. **[[druids-fundamentals/federation-protocols|Federation Protocols]]** - Multi-org coordination

**Time:** 3-4 hours reading, 2-3 hours setup

### Phase 4: Practice (Week 4)

Apply your knowledge:

1. Set up a test repository
2. Document a real meeting
3. Create a campaign plan
4. Practice merge conflicts
5. Implement security tiers

**Time:** 5-6 hours hands-on work

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Styles

### Visual Learners
- Start with diagrams in [[core-concepts/power-steering-metaphor|Power Steering Metaphor]]
- Use [[git-basics/git-through-campaign|Git Through a Campaign]] for story-based learning
- Check out workflow diagrams in implementation guides

### Hands-On Learners
- Jump straight to [[git-basics/git-in-7-commands|Git in 7 Commands]]
- Set up a practice repository immediately
- Learn by breaking things in a safe environment

### Theory-First Learners
- Deep dive into [[core-concepts/democratic-centralism|Democratic Centralism]]
- Read [[core-concepts/tech-democratization-as-class-struggle|Tech Democratization as Class Struggle]]
- Understand the politics before the practice

### Social Learners
- Find a learning partner
- Read [[../teach/teach-tech-without-priest-hood|Teach Tech Without Priesthood]]
- Organize study groups using the materials

## ðŸš€ What's Next?

After completing the learning path:

1. **Implement** - Deploy DRUIDS in your organization
2. **Customize** - Adapt to your specific needs
3. **Teach** - Spread knowledge to other organizers
4. **Contribute** - Share improvements back to the project

### Ready to Put This Into Practice?
**Move forward in your journey:** See the [[../implement/index|Implementation Guide]] for step-by-step deployment instructions.

### Want Visual Overview of Paths?
**See all learning options:** Check out [[visual-roadmaps|Visual Learning Paths]] for complete journey maps based on your organizing context.

### Building From Scratch?
**Start with foundations:** Follow [[tutorials/your-first-revolutionary-commit|Your First Revolutionary Commit]] for hands-on practice.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

1. **Learn together** - Everything is easier with comrades
2. **Start small** - Master basics before adding complexity
3. **Practice regularly** - Daily use builds competence
4. **Ask questions** - No tech priests here
5. **Document your journey** - Help the next person
