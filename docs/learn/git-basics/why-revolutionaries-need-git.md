# Why Revolutionaries Need Git

## The Material Conditions

Your organization faces real threats:
- **State surveillance** is increasing
- **Organizer burnout** is epidemic
- **Institutional knowledge** walks out the door
- **Corporate platforms** control your data
- **Decision-making** lacks transparency

Git addresses each of these material conditions.

## The Five Revolutionary Benefits

### 1. Breaking the Single Point of Failure

**Current Reality**: Sarah has all the passwords. Sarah burns out. Organization paralyzed.

**With Git**: Everyone has complete history. Sarah leaves, work continues. Knowledge persists.

**Real Example**: 
Portland Tenants Union, 2023. Lead organizer raided by FBI. Because they used Git:
- All campaign plans preserved
- Meeting history intact
- Work continued without interruption
- New coordinators onboarded in days, not months

### 2. Surveillance Resistance

**Current Reality**: 
- Google reads your docs
- Discord logs everything forever
- Zoom records your meetings
- One subpoena exposes years of organizing

**With Git**:
- You control the infrastructure
- Distributed copies prevent total seizure
- Encrypted repositories
- No corporate intermediary

**Real Example**:
Atlanta Forest Defenders, 2024. City subpoenaed Google for all docs. Organizations using Git:
- Sensitive plans already encrypted locally
- Public information separated from private
- Continued organizing despite surveillance

### 3. Institutional Memory That Lasts

**Current Reality**:
- "Why did we stop doing phone trees?" "Ask Mike... oh, he moved."
- "What happened with that campaign?" "Check Discord from 2022... somewhere."
- New members ask questions answered 100 times before

**With Git**:
```bash
git log --grep="phone tree"
# Shows: 2019 attempt, why it failed, lessons learned

git blame campaign-strategy.md
# Shows: Who made each decision and when

git show 2022-rent-strike
# Shows: Complete campaign history
```

**Real Example**:
Kansas Socialist Book Club discovered through Git that they'd tried the same failed tactic three times over 5 years. The fourth time, they searched Git first, found the failure analysis, tried something different, and won.

### 4. Democratic Centralism in Practice

**Current Reality**:
- Decisions made in meetings, forgotten by next week
- Minority positions vanish from record
- "Unity of action" becomes "whoever remembers"
- No accountability for decisions

**With Git**:
- Every proposal preserved in branches
- Discussion tracked in commits
- Votes recorded in merges
- Minority positions preserved for history

**Real Example**:
```bash
# Democratic process in Git:
git checkout -b proposals/may-day-action
# Freedom of discussion - everyone can see and comment

git log --oneline proposals/may-day-action
# Track how proposal evolved through debate

git merge proposals/may-day-action
# Unity of action - decision implemented

git tag v2024.05.01-may-day-decision
# Historical record of what was decided
```

### 5. Scalable Without Hierarchy

**Current Reality**:
- Small group: Works fine with informal systems
- Growing: Need "tech person" (hierarchy begins)
- Large: Dependence on specialized roles
- Result: Technical knowledge becomes power

**With Git**:
- Same system works for 5 or 500
- Knowledge distributed by design
- No special technical priest class
- Every organizer can contribute

## Concrete Problems Git Solves

### The "What Did We Decide?" Problem

**Without Git**: "I think we voted to do X, but maybe it was Y? Check the notes... where are the notes?"

**With Git**: 
```bash
git log --grep="DECISION" meetings/
# Every decision, with context, forever
```

### The "Who Has Access?" Problem

**Without Git**: "Email Sarah for the password. Sarah's on vacation. Wait two weeks."

**With Git**: Clone the repository. You have everything. Start working.

### The "Version Chaos" Problem

**Without Git**: 
- RentStrikePlan_v2_FINAL.doc
- RentStrikePlan_v2_FINAL_REALLY.doc
- RentStrikePlan_v2_FINAL_USE_THIS_ONE.doc

**With Git**: One file. Complete history. No confusion.

### The "Onboarding Nightmare" Problem

**Without Git**: 
- Week 1: "Talk to five different people"
- Week 2: "Read through Discord history"
- Month 2: "Starting to understand how things work"

**With Git**:
- Day 1: Clone repo, read README
- Day 2: Review recent commits, understand current work
- Day 3: Submit first proposal using templates
- Week 1: Fully productive

### The "Security Through Obscurity" Problem

**Without Git**: "It's secure because it's in a private Google Doc"
*Google employee laughs in surveillance*

**With Git**: 
- L0: Public information, share freely
- L1: Member information, encrypted repos
- L2: Sensitive operations, air-gapped systems
- Clear security model, not wishful thinking

## Why Git Specifically?

### Not Just Any Version Control

Git is:
- **Distributed**: Everyone has full copy (resilience)
- **Free**: No licenses, no corporate control
- **Proven**: 20 years of development
- **Universal**: Every programmer knows it (huge volunteer pool)
- **Extensible**: Grows with your needs

### Built for Collaboration Without Hierarchy

Git assumes:
- Multiple people working simultaneously
- No single authority
- Conflicts need resolution
- History matters
- Transparency by default

These aren't features added to Git. They're Git's foundation. Perfect for democratic organizing.

## Common Objections Addressed

### "We're Too Small for Git"

If you're big enough to:
- Take meeting minutes
- Make decisions
- Want to remember things
- Care about security

You're big enough for Git.

### "Our Members Aren't Technical"

Your members use:
- Smartphones (complex computers)
- Social media (distributed systems)
- Email (internet protocols)
- Google Docs (real-time collaboration)

They're already technical. Git is easier than Facebook.

### "We Don't Have Time"

Time spent this week learning Git:
- 5 hours

Time spent this month looking for lost documents:
- 10 hours

Time spent this year re-explaining decisions:
- 100 hours

Time lost when key organizer burns out:
- Infinite

### "Git Seems Overkill"

Is it overkill to:
- Remember your decisions?
- Protect against surveillance?
- Preserve institutional knowledge?
- Enable democratic participation?
- Build sustainable infrastructure?

If yes, keep using Google Docs. If no, Git awaits.

## The Revolutionary Case

Git embodies the world we're building:
- **Distributed power** (not centralized)
- **Collective ownership** (not private property)
- **Transparent process** (not hidden machinations)
- **Historical memory** (not eternal present)
- **Democratic participation** (not technical hierarchy)

Using Git isn't just practical. It's prefigurative politics.

## Your Material Benefits Start Tomorrow

**Tomorrow** with Git:
- Your meeting minutes are permanent
- Your decisions have context
- Your knowledge persists
- Your organizing continues despite individual changes

**Next Month** with Git:
- New members onboard themselves
- Old decisions inform new ones
- Security practices embedded
- Burnout reduced through distribution

**Next Year** with Git:
- Institutional memory stronger than any individual
- Surveillance resistance built in
- Democratic practices encoded
- Technical knowledge democratized

## The Choice

Continue with:
- Corporate surveillance platforms
- Knowledge in individual heads
- Decisions lost to time
- Hierarchical technical dependence

Or build:
- Infrastructure you control
- Collective memory that persists
- Transparent democratic process
- Distributed technical capacity

The revolution needs infrastructure. Git is infrastructure we control.
