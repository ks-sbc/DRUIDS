# Git Basics for Organizers

Learn version control through organizing examples. Git isn't programming - it's institutional memory, democratic decision-making, and collective power building.

## Foundation Understanding

### [Git Isn't Programming](./git-isnt-programming.md)
Destroy the intimidation factor. Git is a filing system for collective work, not a programming tool.

### [Why Revolutionaries Need Git](./why-revolutionaries-need-git.md)
Understand the material benefits: institutional memory, democratic transparency, and organizational sustainability.

## Essential Skills

### [Git in 7 Commands](./git-in-7-commands.md)
Master the 90% of Git you'll actually use for organizing work.

### [Git Quick Reference](../../implement/git/git-quick-reference.md)
Quick lookup for commands and common operations.

### [Git Command Reference Card](../../implement/git/git-command-reference-card.md)
Comprehensive reference for all Git operations.

## Daily Practice

### [Daily Git Workflows](./daily-git-workflows.md)
Integrate Git into your regular organizing routines.

### [Visual Git Workflows](./visual-git-workflows.md)
See how Git operations map to organizing processes through diagrams and flowcharts.

## Learning Path

1. **Start Here**: [Git Isn't Programming](./git-isnt-programming.md)
2. **Understand Why**: [Why Revolutionaries Need Git](./why-revolutionaries-need-git.md)
3. **Learn by Doing**: Follow [Git Learning Path](../git-learning-path.md)
4. **Practice**: [Git in 7 Commands](./git-in-7-commands.md)
5. **Apply**: [Daily Git Workflows](./daily-git-workflows.md)

## Key Principles

### Git as Organizing Tool
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple teams can work simultaneously without conflict
- **Democratic Decision Making**: Every change is visible and can be discussed
- **Institutional Memory**: Nothing is ever lost, everything is searchable
- **Collective Ownership**: No single person controls the organizational knowledge

### Revolutionary Approach
- **No Tech Priests**: Anyone can learn and teach Git
- **Material Examples**: All learning uses real organizing scenarios
- **Collective Process**: Focus on group coordination, not individual productivity
- **Security Consciousness**: Protect organizing work from surveillance and disruption
