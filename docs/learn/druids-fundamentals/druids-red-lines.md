# DRUIDS Red Lines: What We Must Never Become

## Defining Through Negation

Sometimes the clearest way to define what you are is to declare what you will never be. These red lines are inviolable. Cross them, and DRUIDS becomes just another tool of control rather than liberation.

## The Absolute Red Lines

### 1. DRUIDS Must Never Become Proprietary

**The Line**: No closed source. No "enterprise editions." No paid features. Ever.

**Why This Matters**: 
- The moment DRUIDS has a price tag, it serves capital
- Proprietary infrastructure creates technical hierarchy
- Revolutionary tools must be commonly owned

**What This Means**:
- ❌ No dual licensing schemes
- ❌ No "open core" with paid additions
- ❌ No copyright assignment to corporations
- ✅ Forever free/libre software
- ✅ All features available to all
- ✅ Community ownership protected

### 2. DRUIDS Must Never Surveil Its Users

**The Line**: No analytics. No telemetry. No tracking. No exceptions.

**Why This Matters**:
- Trust requires privacy
- Data collection enables targeting
- Revolutionary organizations need sanctuary

**What This Means**:
- ❌ No usage statistics
- ❌ No error reporting to central servers
- ❌ No "anonymous" analytics
- ❌ No update checking that phones home
- ✅ Complete local operation
- ✅ Users control their data
- ✅ Network requests only when essential

### 3. DRUIDS Must Never Create Technical Priests

**The Line**: If average organizers can't use it, we've failed.

**Why This Matters**:
- Technical hierarchy reproduces class relations
- Complexity gatekeeps power
- Revolution requires mass participation

**Learn to avoid this:** [Teaching Without Priesthood](../../teach/teach-tech-without-priest-hood.md)

**What This Means**:
- ❌ No features requiring CS degrees
- ❌ No "expert mode" that gates essential functions
- ❌ No documentation assuming technical background
- ✅ Grandmother test: Can your grandmother use it?
- ✅ Progressive disclosure of complexity
- ✅ Community knowledge sharing

### 4. DRUIDS Must Never Depend on Corporate Infrastructure

**The Line**: No hard dependencies on Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.

**Why This Matters**:
- Corporate dependencies create kill switches
- Platform capitalism extracts value
- Revolutionary infrastructure needs autonomy

**What This Means**:
- ❌ No required cloud services
- ❌ No GitHub-only workflows
- ❌ No proprietary dependencies
- ✅ Self-hostable everything
- ✅ Federation over centralization
- ✅ Local-first architecture

### 5. DRUIDS Must Never Impose Ideology

**The Line**: Infrastructure serves movements, not the reverse.

**Why This Matters**:
- Tools shouldn't dictate politics
- Different conditions require different approaches
- Sectarianism kills movements

**What This Means**:
- ❌ No hardcoded political positions
- ❌ No enforced organizational structures
- ❌ No "correct" way to organize
- ✅ Flexible to different tendencies
- ✅ Supports various organizing models
- ✅ Power steering, not compass

### 6. DRUIDS Must Never Sacrifice Security for Convenience

**The Line**: No "easier but unsafe" defaults.

**Why This Matters**:
- State repression is real
- Infiltration destroys movements
- Trust takes years to build, seconds to break

**See our approach:** [Security as Revolutionary Practice](../../learn/core-concepts/druids-security-implementation.md)

**What This Means**:
- ❌ No passwords in plain text
- ❌ No unencrypted sensitive data
- ❌ No "we'll add security later"
- ✅ Security by design
- ✅ Safe defaults always
- ✅ Clear security indicators

### 7. DRUIDS Must Never Become Unmaintainable

**The Line**: If the original developers disappear, DRUIDS must survive.

**Why This Matters**:
- Projects die from complexity
- Bus factor kills tools
- Revolutionary infrastructure must endure

**What This Means**:
- ❌ No clever code without documentation
- ❌ No single points of failure
- ❌ No dependencies on specific individuals
- ✅ Readable, maintainable codebase
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Multiple maintainers always

### 8. DRUIDS Must Never Discriminate

**The Line**: Accessible to all or useful to none.

**Why This Matters**:
- Revolution includes everyone or fails
- Disability justice is revolutionary justice
- Language barriers divide movements

**What This Means**:
- ❌ No English-only assumption
- ❌ No ablest interfaces
- ❌ No cultural defaults
- ✅ Internationalization from start
- ✅ Accessibility as core feature
- ✅ Multiple interface options

### 9. DRUIDS Must Never Promise False Security

**The Line**: Honest about limitations, always.

**Why This Matters**:
- False security kills activists
- Perfect security doesn't exist
- Trust requires honesty

**What This Means**:
- ❌ No "military-grade encryption" marketing
- ❌ No security through obscurity
- ❌ No hiding known vulnerabilities
- ✅ Clear threat model documentation
- ✅ Honest about trade-offs
- ✅ Regular security audits

### 10. DRUIDS Must Never Optimize for Scale Over Community

**The Line**: Better to serve 10 organizations well than 10,000 poorly.

**Why This Matters**:
- Growth-hacking serves capital
- Quality organizes better than quantity
- Deep roots beat shallow spread

**What This Means**:
- ❌ No venture capital metrics
- ❌ No user acquisition funnels
- ❌ No engagement optimization
- ✅ Community needs first
- ✅ Sustainable growth
- ✅ Quality over metrics

## The Positive Commitments

From these red lines emerge positive principles:

### We Will Always:
1. **Prioritize user safety** over all other concerns
2. **Document thoroughly** for future maintainers
3. **Build collectively** with affected communities
4. **Default to transparency** in development
5. **Respect autonomy** of organizations using DRUIDS
6. **Learn from failure** without hiding mistakes
7. **Credit all labor** that builds the project
8. **Maintain simplicity** as a feature
9. **Preserve history** for future struggle
10. **Serve movements** not careers

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Technical Enforcement
- License requires derivative works stay free
- Architecture prevents centralized control
- Code structure maintains simplicity

### Social Enforcement
- Community governance model
- Transparent decision making
- Public accountability

### Political Enforcement  
- Connection to revolutionary movements
- Accountability to users not funders
- Principles over personalities

## When Tensions Arise

Sometimes principles conflict. When they do:

1. **User safety** trumps everything
2. **Collective ownership** beats individual control
3. **Movement needs** outweigh technical elegance
4. **Accessibility** matters more than features
5. **Sustainability** beats rapid growth

## The Living Document

These red lines aren't commandments from above. They're collective agreements from below. As movements evolve, so might these principles - but only through democratic process, never through drift or convenience.

### To Propose Changes:
1. Document the material conditions requiring change
2. Propose specific amendment
3. Allow community discussion period
4. Require supermajority approval
5. Document dissent for history

## The Revolutionary Wager

We bet that:
- Tools shape movements
- Infrastructure is political
- Collective ownership beats private control
- Security enables rather than restricts
- Simplicity serves better than complexity

DRUIDS exists to prove this wager correct.

## Your Responsibility

If you use DRUIDS, you inherit these red lines. If you contribute to DRUIDS, you enforce them. If you see them crossed, you must speak.

These aren't guidelines. They're guardrails against becoming what we fight.
