# DRUIDS Fundamentals

DRUIDS isn't just Git for organizing - it's a complete framework for democratic, revolutionary organizing infrastructure. Learn what makes it different and powerful.

## Core Distinctions

### [Revolutionary Commit Conventions](./revolutionary-commit-conventions.md)
How commit messages become democratic communication, encoding decisions and preserving dissent.

### [Democratic Centralism Code Review](./democratic-centralism-code-review.md)
Transform code review into collective decision-making that strengthens both technical and political work.

### [DRUIDS Red Lines](./druids-red-lines.md)
Understand the non-negotiable principles that keep DRUIDS serving revolutionary organizing.

## Integration and Practice

### [Obsidian Integration](./obsidian-integration.md)
Use familiar tools while building revolutionary infrastructure - no command line required for daily work.

### [Federation Protocols](./federation-protocols.md)
Connect multiple organizations while maintaining autonomy and security.

### [Philosophy](./philosophy.md)
The political and theoretical foundations that guide DRUIDS development and implementation.

## What Makes DRUIDS Different

### From Generic Git
- **Organizing-First Design**: Every feature serves collective organizing
- **Security by Default**: Built-in protection for vulnerable communities
- **Democratic Process**: Tools that support consensus and collective decision-making
- **Revolutionary Values**: Explicit political framework guiding all development

### From Corporate Tools
- **Collective Ownership**: Organizations control their own infrastructure
- **No Surveillance**: No corporate monitoring or data mining
- **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable, modifiable by users
- **Movement Building**: Designed to strengthen organizing capacity

### From Tech Solutions
- **Political Analysis**: Understanding power relations in technology choices
- **Collective Implementation**: Group processes, not individual expertise
- **Revolutionary Framework**: Grounded in liberation struggle, not efficiency
- **Democratic Participation**: Tools serve organizing, don't replace it

## Implementation Approach

### Political Foundation
1. **Understand the Analysis**: Why current tools fail revolutionary organizing
2. **Collective Decision**: Organizational commitment to democratic infrastructure
3. **Security Assessment**: Threat modeling for your specific context
4. **Strategic Planning**: Implementation that builds collective capacity

### Technical Implementation
1. **Start Small**: Begin with low-risk, high-value use cases
2. **Build Skills**: Develop collective technical capacity
3. **Iterate Safely**: Test and refine in secure environments
4. **Scale Sustainably**: Expand without creating dependencies

### Organizational Integration
1. **Democratic Process**: Involve everyone in infrastructure decisions
2. **Skill Sharing**: Rotate technical responsibilities
3. **Cultural Change**: Embed democratic practices in daily work
4. **Movement Connection**: Share knowledge with other organizations
