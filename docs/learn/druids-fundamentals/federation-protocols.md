# Federation Protocols

## What Is Federation?

Federation allows multiple autonomous organizations to coordinate without sacrificing independence. Like allied nations cooperating while maintaining sovereignty, federated DRUIDS instances share knowledge while preserving organizational autonomy.

## Core Principles

### 1. Autonomy First
Each organization maintains:
- Independent repositories
- Local decision-making
- Security boundaries
- Organizational culture

### 2. Selective Sharing
Organizations choose what to share:
- Public campaigns (L0)
- Joint strategies (L1)
- Never sensitive operations (L2)

### 3. Consensus Protocols
Shared decisions require:
- Proposal documentation
- Discussion period
- Consent process
- Implementation plan

### 4. Technical Interoperability
All federated orgs use:
- Compatible Git workflows
- Shared commit conventions
- Common security tiers
- Standardized structures

## Federation Architecture

### Hub and Spoke Model
```
    Local Org A
         |
    Federation Hub ---- Local Org B
         |
    Local Org C
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear coordination point
- Simplified syncing
- Reduced complexity
- Easier onboarding

### Mesh Network Model
```
Org A ---- Org B
  |   \  /   |
  |    \/    |
  |    /\    |
  |   /  \   |
Org C ---- Org D
```

**Benefits**:
- No single point of failure
- Direct org relationships
- Maximum autonomy
- Resilient structure

### Hybrid Model (Recommended)
- Regional hubs for coordination
- Direct links for close partners
- Flexible routing
- Scales with movement

## Technical Implementation

### Setting Up Federation

#### 1. Establish Federation Repository
```bash
# Create shared federation space
git init federation-hub
cd federation-hub

# Set up structure
mkdir -p campaigns/joint
mkdir -p resources/shared
mkdir -p protocols/federation
```

#### 2. Configure Access Controls
```bash
# Add participating organizations
git remote add org-a https://org-a.druids/federation.git
git remote add org-b https://org-b.druids/federation.git

# Set up GPG signing
git config --local commit.gpgsign true
git config --local user.signingkey FEDERATION_KEY
```

#### 3. Define Sharing Protocols
Create `protocols/federation/sharing-agreement.md`:
- What content is shared
- How decisions are made
- Conflict resolution process
- Security boundaries

### Synchronization Patterns

#### Push Pattern (Contributing)
```bash
# Organization shares campaign
git checkout -b joint/housing-campaign
cp campaigns/local/housing.md campaigns/joint/
git add campaigns/joint/housing.md
git commit -m "SHARE: Housing campaign for federation"
git push federation joint/housing-campaign
```

#### Pull Pattern (Receiving)
```bash
# Organization gets shared resources
git fetch federation
git checkout federation/main
git diff main federation/main
git merge federation/main --no-ff
```

#### Selective Sync
```bash
# Only sync specific directories
git sparse-checkout init
git sparse-checkout set campaigns/joint resources/shared
git pull federation main
```

## Content Standards

### Shared Campaigns
Must include:
- Clear objectives
- Resource needs
- Timeline
- Contact protocols
- Success metrics

### Resource Library
Standardized:
- Naming conventions
- Metadata headers
- License terms
- Attribution

### Protocol Documentation
Required elements:
- Purpose statement
- Participant list
- Decision process
- Amendment procedure

## Governance Models

### Spokescouncil
- Each org sends delegate
- Rotating facilitation
- Consensus decisions
- Quarterly meetings

### Working Groups
- Task-specific teams
- Cross-org membership
- Autonomous operation
- Report to spokescouncil

### Emergency Protocols
- Rapid response network
- Pre-authorized actions
- Security triggers
- Communication trees

## Security Considerations

### Information Barriers
- L2 never federated
- L1 requires explicit consent
- L0 shared by default
- Clear markings required

### Trust Networks
- GPG key signing parties
- Verified communication channels
- Known contact lists
- Regular security audits

### Incident Response
- Breach notification within 24h
- Coordinated response
- Shared security updates
- Lessons learned process

## Common Patterns

### Regional Federations
- Geographic proximity
- Shared conditions
- Joint campaigns
- Resource pooling

### Sector Federations
- Similar work (tenants, labor, etc.)
- Shared strategies
- Best practices
- Skill sharing

### Campaign Federations
- Temporary coordination
- Specific objectives
- Sunset clauses
- Asset distribution

## Conflict Resolution

### Technical Conflicts
1. Document disagreement
2. Seek technical solution
3. Test both approaches
4. Choose by consensus

### Political Conflicts
1. Clarify positions
2. Find common ground
3. Agree to disagree
4. Maintain autonomy

### Resource Conflicts
1. Assess actual needs
2. Transparent allocation
3. Rotation systems
4. Abundance mindset

## Success Metrics

### Healthy Federation Signs
- Regular contributions
- Active participation
- Conflict resolution
- Growing capacity
- Maintained autonomy

### Warning Signs
- Centralization creep
- Inactive members
- Unresolved conflicts
- Security breaches
- Resource hoarding

## Getting Started

### For Organizations
1. Assess federation readiness
2. Identify potential partners
3. Propose initial structure
4. Start small pilot

### For Federations
1. Create founding documents
2. Establish technical infrastructure
3. Run test campaigns
4. Iterate based on experience

## Case Studies

### Tenant Federation Example
Five tenant unions sharing:
- Winning strategies
- Legal resources
- Organizer training
- City-wide campaigns

### Labor Federation Example
Sector-wide coordination:
- Contract language library
- Strike support protocols
- Skill sharing networks
- Joint negotiations

## Remember

Federation multiplies power while preserving autonomy. The goal isn't unity for unity's sake, but strategic coordination for revolutionary capacity.

Strong federations are built on:
- Clear agreements
- Technical standards
- Mutual respect
- Shared victories
