# Why DRUIDS?

**Not sure this is for you?** Check out our [Visual Learning Paths](../learn/visual-roadmaps.md) to see different journeys based on your organizing context.

## The Material Reality

Your revolutionary organization is hemorrhaging knowledge. Every time an experienced organizer burns out, years of lessons walk out the door. New members take months to become productive, asking the same questions that have been answered dozens of times before.

Meanwhile, your data lives on corporate surveillance platforms that read every word, log every connection, and hand it all to the state when subpoenaed.

**DRUIDS changes this.**

## What is DRUIDS?

DRUIDS (Democratic, Resilient, Unity-building Information Distribution System) is infrastructure for revolutionary organizations that:

- **Preserves institutional memory** - Every decision, lesson, and campaign becomes permanent organizational knowledge
- **Accelerates onboarding** - New members become productive in days, not months
- **Resists surveillance** - You control the infrastructure, not Google or Discord
- **Enables democratic process** - Transparent decision-making with preserved dissent
- **Scales without hierarchy** - Same system works for 5 or 500 members

## The Two Core Problems We Solve

### 1. Institutional Memory Loss

**Without DRUIDS:**
- "Why did we stop doing phone banking?" 
- "Ask Sarah... oh, she moved last year."
- Knowledge trapped in individual heads
- Repeated mistakes from forgotten lessons
- Campaigns starting from scratch

**With DRUIDS:**
```bash
git log --grep="phone banking"
# Shows: 2019 attempt, why it failed, lessons learned
```
- Complete campaign histories preserved
- Decisions tracked with context
- Lessons compound over time
- Knowledge survives personnel changes

### 2. Onboarding Burnout

**Without DRUIDS:**
- Experienced organizers exhausted by repetitive explanations
- New members lost for months
- Same training given individually
- Institutional knowledge gatekept by availability

**With DRUIDS:**
- Self-service onboarding from day one
- Templates enforce best practices
- Past decisions provide context
- New members contribute immediately

## DRUIDS is Power Steering, Not a Compass

DRUIDS doesn't give you ideology or direction - that comes from your revolutionary politics. DRUIDS makes the journey easier:

- **Traditional organizing**: Like driving without power steering - every turn exhausts
- **With DRUIDS**: Same destination, but you arrive with energy to fight

Think of it as infrastructure, like roads. The Romans built roads that everyone used - revolutionaries, merchants, and yes, even armies. But revolutionaries used them to spread uprising, not empire.

## Based on Real Organizing Needs

DRUIDS is in development because we've seen these patterns repeatedly:

- Organizations using Git for some things, Google Docs for others, Signal for coordination - but nothing talks to each other
- Security practices that are either too lax (everything on Google) or too strict (can't get work done)
- The same knowledge gaps appearing in organization after organization

DRUIDS integrates proven tools (Git, encryption, distributed systems) into a cohesive framework designed specifically for revolutionary organizing.

## Who DRUIDS is For

✅ **Revolutionary organizations** tired of losing knowledge  
✅ **Union organizers** building sustainable campaigns  
✅ **Mutual aid networks** coordinating without hierarchy  
✅ **Study groups** preserving political education  
✅ **Any group** that values democracy over efficiency  

❌ **Not for:** Corporations, NGOs, electoral campaigns, or anyone comfortable with surveillance capitalism

## Getting Started is Simple

1. **Assess your pain** - What knowledge do you lose when people leave?
2. **Start small** - Begin with meeting minutes in Git
3. **Build habits** - Make documentation part of organizing
4. **Expand gradually** - Add security tiers as needed

**Ready to see it in action?** Try our [Quick Demo](../start/quick-demo.md) - just 5 minutes to see the power.

**Need the theory first?** Dive into [Institutional Memory](../learn/core-concepts/institutional-memory.md) to understand the problem deeply.

## The Choice

Continue with:
- Google reading your plans
- Discord forgetting your history
- Knowledge walking out the door
- Burnout from repetitive work

Or build:
- Infrastructure you control
- Memory that persists
- Democracy that scales
- Capacity that compounds
