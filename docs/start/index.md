# Is DRUIDS Right for Your Organization?

## Quick Assessment (2 minutes)

Answer these questions about your organization:

### Knowledge & Memory
- [ ] When experienced members leave, do you lose critical knowledge?
- [ ] Do new members ask questions that have been answered many times before?
- [ ] Have you ever repeated a failed tactic because no one remembered the previous attempt?
- [ ] Is important information scattered across emails, docs, and people's memories?

### Security & Control
- [ ] Are you uncomfortable with Google/Discord/Zoom having access to your organizing data?
- [ ] Have you worried about platform shutdowns or account suspensions?
- [ ] Do you need different security levels for different information?
- [ ] Would a subpoena to a tech company expose years of organizing?

### Process & Democracy
- [ ] Do decisions get made but then forgotten or poorly documented?
- [ ] Is it hard to track who decided what and when?
- [ ] Do minority positions disappear from the record?
- [ ] Does your tech setup reinforce hierarchies you're trying to eliminate?

### Sustainability
- [ ] Do organizers burn out from explaining the same things repeatedly?
- [ ] Does onboarding new members take weeks or months?
- [ ] Are you dependent on one or two "tech people"?
- [ ] Would your organizing survive if key people suddenly left?

**If you checked 3+ boxes, DRUIDS will transform your organizing.**

## What Makes DRUIDS Different

| Traditional Tools | DRUIDS |
|------------------|---------|
| Corporate surveillance | You control the infrastructure |
| Knowledge in individual heads | Institutional memory that persists |
| Months to onboard | Days to productivity |
| Tech hierarchy | Democratized knowledge |
| Repeated mistakes | Lessons compound over time |

Get running in under an hour

### ðŸ“š **"We need to understand first"**
â†’ Start with **[[why-druids|Why DRUIDS?]]**  
Deep dive into problems and solutions

### ðŸŽ¯ **"Show me what it does"**

**Different organizing context?** Check [[visual-roadmaps|Visual Learning Paths]] for paths tailored to labor unions, tenant organizing, or direct action groups.

## Common Concerns Addressed

**"We're not technical"**  
If your members can use smartphones and social media, they can use DRUIDS. We've eliminated unnecessary complexity.

**"We're too small"**  
If you take meeting minutes and make decisions, you're big enough for DRUIDS. It scales from 3 to 300.

**"We don't have time"**  
How much time do you waste looking for lost documents? Explaining things repeatedly? DRUIDS saves more time than it takes.

**"Seems like overkill"**  
Is preserving institutional memory overkill? Is security overkill? Is sustainable organizing overkill?

## Why We're Building This

DRUIDS is currently in active development by the Kansas Socialist Book Club. We're building it because we've experienced these exact problems in our own organizing and seen them repeated across movements. 

While DRUIDS hasn't been deployed yet, it's based on proven technologies (Git, Obsidian, strong encryption) that revolutionary organizations are already using separately. DRUIDS integrates them into a cohesive system designed specifically for organizing needs.

## Next Steps
