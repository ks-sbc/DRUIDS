# Onboarding Yourself in 3 Days

## You're Not Starting From Zero

Every organizer brings experience. Maybe you've:
- Lost meeting notes in someone's Google Drive
- Watched experienced comrades burn out taking all knowledge with them
- Repeated the same mistakes because no one remembered last year's campaign
- Felt dependent on "the tech person" who might leave tomorrow

DRUIDS transforms these material problems into collective strength. In three days, you'll build the capacity to never lose organizing history again.

## Before You Begin: Material Requirements

**Technical**:
- A computer (any operating system)
- Internet for initial setup
- 30 minutes of uninterrupted time per day

**Political**:
- Understanding that tools shape organizing
- Commitment to collective ownership over individual expertise
- Patience with yourself while learning

**Ready to build collective memory?** Let's begin.

## Day 1: Understanding the Vision (2-3 hours)

### Morning: Why DRUIDS Exists

Start here to ground yourself in the political purpose:

1. **Read: [[why-druids|Why DRUIDS?]]**
   - Understand the material problems we solve
   - See how Google/Discord fail revolutionary organizations

2. **Read: [[../learn/explanations/institutional-memory-and-onboarding|Institutional Memory and Onboarding]]**
   - Deep dive into the two key pain points DRUIDS solves
   - Understand why organizations hemorrhage knowledge
   - Learn why democratic centralism needs version control

2. **Experience: [[quick-demo|Quick Demo]]**
   - See DRUIDS in action (5 minutes)
   - Understand the daily workflow
   - Visualize your organization using this

3. **Reflect: Your Organization's Pain Points**
   Write down:
   - What knowledge has your organization lost?
   - Who holds critical information alone?
   - What would happen if they left tomorrow?

### Afternoon: Core Concepts

Now understand the revolutionary theory behind the tools:

1. **Study: [[institutional-memory|Institutional Memory]]**
   - Why organizations hemorrhage knowledge
   - How memory builds revolutionary capacity
   - The compound effect of preserved struggle

2. **Study: [[democratic-centralism|Democratic Centralism in Practice]]**
   - Freedom of discussion = branches
   - Unity of action = merges
   - Minority positions preserved in history

3. **Study: [[druids-security-implementation|DRUIDS Security Implementation]]**
   - Security through political clarity, not paranoia
   - Three-tier model for real threats
   - Why perfect security is liberal fantasy

### Evening: Self-Assessment

**Political Check-in**:
- Do you understand why technical infrastructure is political?
- Can you explain DRUIDS to a comrade in your own words?
- Are you ready to democratize technical knowledge?

**Continue when you can answer yes to all three.**

## Day 2: Learning By Doing (3-4 hours)

### Morning: Your First Repository

Time to get your hands dirty. No more theory without practice:

1. **Install Git**: [[complete-setup-guide|Complete Setup Guide]]
   - Platform-specific instructions
   - Common troubleshooting
   - Verification steps

2. **Learn Through Story**: [[git-through-campaign|Git Through a Campaign]]
   - Follow organizers through a rent strike
   - Learn commands through material needs
   - See democracy in action through merges

3. **Practice the Basics**:
   ```bash
   # Create your practice repository
   mkdir druids-practice
   cd druids-practice
   git init
   
   # Document your first meeting
   echo "# Practice Meeting Notes" > meetings/first-meeting.md
   git add meetings/
   git commit -m "Document first practice meeting"
   ```

### Afternoon: Collaborative Workflows

Now learn how teams work together:

1. **Essential Commands**: [[git-in-7-commands|Git in 7 Commands]]
   - The 90% you'll use daily
   - Practical examples from organizing
   - Common patterns

2. **Practice Collaboration**:
   - Create a branch for proposals
   - Make changes in parallel
   - Merge different perspectives
   - Resolve conflicts democratically

3. **Security Basics**: [[help-committed-sensitive-data|Help, I Committed Sensitive Data!]]
   - What not to commit
   - Emergency procedures
   - Building security habits

### Evening: Integration

**Technical Check-in**:
- Can you create a repository?
- Can you commit meeting notes?
- Can you create and merge branches?
- Do you understand what NOT to commit?

**Ready to contribute? Tomorrow you become a teacher.**

## Day 3: Contributing and Teaching (2-3 hours)

### Morning: Your First Contribution

Join the collective by contributing:

1. **Choose Your Role**:
   - **Secretary?** Read [[meeting-workflow-guide|Meeting Workflows]]
   - **Coordinator?** Read [[project-management-guide|Project Management]]
   - **Educator?** Read [[teach-tech-without-priest-hood|Teaching Without Priesthood]]

2. **Make Your First Real Commit**:
   - Document an actual meeting
   - Create a proposal
   - Write a reflection
   - Fix a typo in documentation

3. **Submit for Review**:
   - Push your branch
   - Create a pull request
   - Engage with feedback
   - See democracy in action

### Afternoon: Preparing to Teach

The revolution spreads through teaching:

1. **Understand Pedagogy**: [[teach-tech-without-priest-hood|Teaching Tech Without Creating Priests]]
   - Rotate the keyboard
   - Demystify through practice
   - Build collective capacity

2. **Plan Your First Workshop**:
   - Identify 2-3 comrades to teach
   - Choose a real organizing task
   - Prepare simple exercises
   - Schedule within a week

3. **Create Learning Materials**:
   - Adapt examples to your context
   - Use your organization's campaigns
   - Build on existing struggles

### Evening: Reflection and Commitment

**Capacity Check-in**:
- Can you preserve organizational memory?
- Can you work collaboratively with Git?
- Can you teach another comrade?
- Will you commit to daily practice?

## Your Ongoing Journey

### Week 1: Daily Practice
- Commit one thing daily (meeting notes, ideas, reflections)
- Read one new document each day
- Help one comrade with Git

### Week 2: Deepen Understanding
- Study [Advanced Workflows](../implement/workflows/)
- Implement [Security Practices](../implement/security/)
- Run your first workshop

### Month 1: Build Infrastructure
- Migrate from corporate platforms
- Establish team workflows
- Document your first campaign

### Month 3: Revolutionary Routine
- Git becomes invisible infrastructure
- Knowledge compounds daily
- New members onboard themselves
- Your organization remembers everything

## Common Challenges and Solutions

**"I'm not technical"**
- Neither were most organizers using DRUIDS
- You learned to organize; you can learn this
- Focus on one command at a time

**"I don't have time"**
- How much time do you waste re-explaining things?
- 30 minutes daily prevents hours of future confusion
- This IS organizing work, not extra work

**"My organization resists change"**
- Start with yourself
- Demonstrate value through practice
- Let results speak louder than arguments

**"I'm stuck on something"**
- Check [[qm-troubleshooting|QM Troubleshooting]]
- Ask in community forums
- Remember: every expert was once confused

## Success Metrics

You're ready when:
- ✅ You commit without thinking about commands
- ✅ You naturally document decisions with context
- ✅ You've taught at least one other person
- ✅ You can't imagine organizing without version control

## Next Steps

**Immediate**:
1. Set up your organization's first repository
2. Document your next meeting
3. Schedule a workshop

**This Week**:
- Read [[daily-git-workflows|Daily Git Workflows]]
- Study [[security-playbook|Security Playbook]]
- Plan migration from corporate platforms

**This Month**:
- Run [[git-through-campaign-template|Git Workshop]]
- Implement [[three-tier-system|Three-Tier Security]]
- Build your first [[project-management-guide|Project Management Setup]]

## Remember

Every commit is a small act of revolution. Every push shares knowledge with comrades. Every merge strengthens democratic practice.

You're not just learning Git. You're building infrastructure for liberation.

**The revolution will be committed, one decision at a time.**
