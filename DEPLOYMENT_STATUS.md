# Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **MkDocs Build**: `mkdocs build -c` runs successfully
2. **MkDocs Serve**: Server runs at http://localhost:8000
3. **Obsidian Support**: Using pub-obsidian plugin for wikilinks
4. **Configuration**: Valid YAML with Material theme
5. **Plugins**: 
   - search (built-in)
   - pub-debugger (for troubleshooting)
   - pub-obsidian (for wikilinks)
   - git-revision-date-localized
   - tags

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **Broken Links**: Some wikilinks point to non-existent files
   - Index.md has links to files that don't exist yet
   - Some blog post links need adjustment
   - These are warnings, not errors

2. **Strict Mode**: Build fails in strict mode due to warnings
   - This is expected during development
   - For deployment, use `mkdocs build --clean`

## üöÄ Ready for Deployment

The site is ready to deploy to GitHub Pages with:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy --clean
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. Fix broken links by creating missing pages or updating links
2. Add more content to demonstrate Obsidian features
3. Customize theme colors and styling
4. Add real Giscus configuration for comments

## üß† Session Notes for Future Claude

### Context
This MkDocs setup uses the MkDocs Publisher suite (mkdocs-publisher package) which includes:
- pub-obsidian: Handles Obsidian wikilinks, backlinks, and callouts
- pub-debugger: Provides enhanced logging (disable zip_log to avoid errors)
- pub-meta: Can filter pages by publish status (removed to simplify)

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Chose MkDocs Publisher over individual plugins** - Better integration for Obsidian features
2. **Disabled strict mode for builds** - Allows deployment with warnings during development
3. **Simplified plugin configuration** - Removed unrecognized options like `img_lazy`
4. **TDD approach** - Tests in `tests/test_deployment_readiness.py` define success criteria

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **AttributeError in pub-debugger**: Set `zip_log: enabled: false`
2. **Broken wikilinks**: Use relative paths (e.g., `[[../page]]` from subdirectories)
3. **Module import errors in tests**: Check package vs import names (mkdocs-material vs material)
4. **Build warnings**: Normal during development, use `mkdocs build --clean` (not --strict)

### Working Configuration
- Theme: Material for MkDocs
- Plugins: search, pub-debugger, pub-obsidian, git-revision-date-localized, tags
- Wikilinks: Enabled via pub-obsidian
- Build command: `mkdocs build --clean`
- Serve: `mkdocs serve` (default port 8000)

### Test Status
All 13 deployment readiness tests pass. The test suite validates:
- Configuration validity
- Plugin installation
- Build success
- Server functionality
- Wikilink support
- GitHub Pages readiness

### Remember
- This setup prioritizes Obsidian compatibility over zero warnings
- The pub-* plugins are from mkdocs-publisher, not separate packages
- Blog posts don't need to be in nav - that's normal for blog plugin
- Use `./mkdocs.sh` helper script for common operations
