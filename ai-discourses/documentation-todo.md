## Notes on Priority

**Highest Priority**: Migration guides and basic Git tutorials. Can't organize if people can't use the tools.

**Security Close Second**: Every day without proper security is risk accumulation.

**Political Education Woven Throughout**: Not separate docs but integrated into everything.

**Success Stories Wait**: Don't invent social proof. Document reality as it develops.

## How to Use This Document

1. Pick a task from "Immediate Needs"
2. Create the document
3. Mark complete with [x]
4. Add new needs as discovered
5. Move items between categories as priorities shift

Remember: Every document should advance revolutionary capacity. No corporate bullshit, no liberal hedging, just tools for liberation.
