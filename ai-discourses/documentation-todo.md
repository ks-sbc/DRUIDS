# DRUIDS Documentation TODO Tracker

*FULLY REORGANIZED BY DIÁTAXIS TYPE - 2025-07-02*

## What Changed in This Reorganization

Previously, tasks were grouped by topic (Migration, Security, Git, etc.). Now they're organized by documentation type, making it clear what KIND of document to write. This ensures:

1. **Clear Purpose**: Each document serves ONE user need
2. **No Mixed Types**: Tutorials teach, how-tos guide, references inform, explanations deepen
3. **User-Focused**: Organized by what comrades need to do, not by our categories
4. **Revolutionary Pedagogy**: Maps to how people actually learn and organize

## Documentation Types (Diátaxis Framework)

### Quick Reference - The Documentation Compass
Ask two questions to determine type:
1. **ACTION or COGNITION?** (doing vs understanding)
2. **ACQUIRE or APPLY?** (learning vs using)

| Purpose | Acquire | Apply |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Action** | Tutorial | How-To Guide |
| **Cognition** | Explanation | Reference |

## Priority Analysis (Through Diátaxis Lens)

**Start with TUTORIALS**: Comrades need to learn by doing. "Your First Revolutionary Commit" unlocks everything else.

**HOW-TO GUIDES Enable Action**: Migration guides and security procedures let organizations escape corporate surveillance TODAY.

**REFERENCE Supports Daily Work**: Templates and quick references remove friction from organizing.

**EXPLANATION Builds Consciousness**: Theory documents deepen understanding but come after practical capability.

## The Dialectical Beauty

Notice how Diátaxis maps to revolutionary pedagogy:
- **Tutorials** = Mass line (learn from the people by teaching them)
- **How-To** = Praxis (theory into practice)
- **Reference** = Democratic centralism (shared standards)
- **Explanation** = Political education (consciousness building)

## How to Use This Document

1. Pick a task from "Immediate Needs"
2. Create the document
3. Mark complete with [x]
4. Add new needs as discovered
5. Move items between categories as priorities shift

Remember: Every document should advance revolutionary capacity. No corporate bullshit, no liberal hedging, just tools for liberation.
