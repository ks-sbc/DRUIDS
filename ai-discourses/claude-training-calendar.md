## Success Metrics

**Not measured by**:
- Test scores
- Completion rates
- Technical expertise alone

**Measured by**:
- Organizing capacity increased
- Security incidents prevented
- Burnout reduced
- Knowledge successfully preserved
- Democratic participation improved
- Movements strengthened

## Continuous Improvement

This calendar is a living document. Each cohort should:
1. Document what worked
2. Identify gaps
3. Propose improvements
4. Test modifications
5. Share with movement

Remember: We're not training technicians. We're building revolutionary capacity.
